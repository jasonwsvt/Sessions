        <h1>Energy Testing - Truth and Falsity</h1>
        <p>For example, instead of energy testing a question, like "what emotion am I feeling?", it’s best to actually test the statement, "the emotion I'm feeling is …" You can then test a single emotion, or narrow down a range of emotions from the list I’ll provide later until only one tests true.</p>
