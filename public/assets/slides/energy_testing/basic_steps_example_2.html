        <h1>Energy Testing - A simple example</h1>
        <p>Now consider the declarative statement, “my name is Inigo Montoya.”</p>

        <ol>
            <li>First I focus on the statement, “my name is Inigo Montoya.”</li>
            <li>Next, I use the energy testing method I use to perform the test.</li>
            <li>Finally, I observe the response to the energy test - False.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>“My name is Inigo Montoya” is not an issue, but similarly to an issue it produces a false response ecause it is disharmonic with what my subconscious knows to be true about myself.</p>
