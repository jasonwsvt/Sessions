        <h1>Energy Testing - Truth and Falsity</h1>
        <p>Everything you energy test is responded to with either true, false, or something else that might be unclear. We’ll cover what to do in the case of unclear responses later.  The best things to energy test are either implicitly or explicitly in the form of a declarative statement.</p>
        <p>For example, instead of energy testing a question, like "what emotion am I feeling?", it’s best to actually test the statement, "the emotion I'm feeling is …" You can then test a single emotion, or narrow down a range of emotions from the list I’ll provide later until only one tests true.</p>
