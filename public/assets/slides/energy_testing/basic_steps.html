        <h1>Energy Testing - Basic Steps</h1>
        <p>There are three basic steps to energy testing.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Focus on the thing you want to energy test.
                This could be a statement, belief, feeling, or substance.
                Do not energy test questions.  The response of an energy tested question is based on how harmonious the question itself is to your subconscious, and not the answer to the question.
            </li>
            <li>
                Perform the test using the method of your choosing.
                Iâ€™ll explain the method I use shortly.  If you already use or would like to use another method instead, there are plenty of resources available online.
            </li>
            <li>
                Observe and interpret the response to the energy test.
                The true and false responses for energy tests should be very clear, regardless of which method you use.
