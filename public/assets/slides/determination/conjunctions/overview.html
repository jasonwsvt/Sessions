        <h1>Issue Determination - Conjunctions:</h1>
        <p>On the following slide I show a list of 22 conjunctions.  Just like other parts of my technique, I determined these terms by trial and error, but while the other parts are fairly straightforward, I would venture to say most of  these donâ€™t make any sense at all.  Finding a term, using it in a reason, having the reason test true, and having the issue I was experiencing resolve, when other methods were not offered, serves as significant positive reinforcement.</p>
