        <h1>Issue Determination - Source Creator System:</h1>
        <p>While I don't understand much about these things, it does test true that while Maker is a creator, it's slightly different from the other creators in some fundamental way. It also tests true that like a tree originating at Maker, there are an unfathomable number of creators outside of this chain.  You are welcome to communicate with all of these entities using energy testing.</p>
