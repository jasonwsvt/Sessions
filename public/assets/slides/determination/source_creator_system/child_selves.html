        <h1>Issue Determination - Child Selves:</h1>
        <p>It is also my understanding that within each of Source, Maker, and all the creators, there exists a child self for all who have entered it.  In other words, you have a Source Child Self, a Maker Child Self, etc.  Each of these child selves may come up in healing work.</p>
