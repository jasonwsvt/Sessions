        <h1>Issue Determination - Source and Creator:</h1>
        <p>It's common to believe Source and Creator are the same thing, and in a way, they are, as Source is everything.  But it can help to think of them as separate, especially for healing and navigation.  Source can be described as the all-knowing, all-loving, all-powerful, all-inclusive, all things, the One, and the Whole. Creator is my name for our Universe, or really, our Multiverse.</p>
        <p>In between Creator and Source are Creator Parent, Creator One, and Maker, so in a way, it's easy to imagine this system as a chain.</p>
        <p>As Source is everything, it might help to describe this system as a Venn diagram - a set of concentric circles of varying size, where Source is the largest circle, and Creator is the smallest.  Maker is a part of Source, Creator One is a part of Maker, etc.</p>
        <p>In using the above analogies, one might overlook all the other Creators.  For this reason, it might help to imagine this system as a tree, with Source as the seed, Maker as the trunk, and all the limbs, branches, and twigs, as the Creators.  The lowest, thickest, oldest limb, connected right to the Maker trunk, is Creator One.  One of the myriad branches off of the Creator One limb is Creator Parent, and one of the many, many twigs off of the Creator Parent branch is Creator.</p>
