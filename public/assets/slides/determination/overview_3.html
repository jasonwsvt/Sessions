        <h1>Issue Determination - Overview:</h1>
        <p>For the cynic or scientist, the Because Reasons map can be divided into three groups: quasi-believable, not so believable, and downright absurd.  Regardless, all of these components I will describe in this section come up in the determination process either as things to be healed or otherwise cleared from the body, or entities doing a healing.  Usually you need to determine the thing to be healed, rarely do you need to determine the entity doing the healing (in my experience it has usually been my higher self), and extremely rarely do you need to determine both.</p>
