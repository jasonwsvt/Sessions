        <h1>Issue Determination - Energy System - The Aura:</h1>
        <p>The aura is a roughly egg-shaped field that surrounds the body.  It tests true that the aura is divided into four quadrants - upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right.  One or more quadrants, or the whole aura, may come up in energy work for healing.</p>
