        <h1>Issue Determination - Consciousness Levels:</h1>
        <p>Iâ€™ll need to explain a little bit about levels of consciousness before getting into emotions.  Way back in the beginning of the presentation I mentioned Dr. Hawkins and his Map of Consciousness.  Displayed here is the portion of the map that is applicable to this presentation, and to Because Reasons.  Remember that the number in the Log column is the consciousness level of the emotion listed in the Level column.  Dr. Hawkins describes a dividing line between courage and pride that separates constructive and destructive, healthy and unhealthy, truth and falsehood.  Emotions calibrating above 200 are increasing constructive, healthy, and truthful.  Emotions calibrating below 200 are increasingly destructive, unhealthy, and false.</p>
