        <h1>Issue Determination - Level of Consciousness:</h1>
        <p>Hawkins uses the term “level of consciousness” to describe a certain quality of a person, people, or their beliefs, actions, or creations, but as far as I can tell, there is not an explicit definition for it.  I would like to provide the following one:</p>
        <p>Consciousness level:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center;">“The breadth of inclusiveness of the worldview from which consciousness is expressed.”</p>
        <p>By this I mean that the consciousness level of someone or something is directly correlated with their expressed or represented acceptance of, and identity with, other.</p>
