        <h1>Issue Determination - Ascended Masters:</h1>
        <p>Ascended Masters are described as benevolent beings who were once human, ascended spiritually, and now work to help raise humanity into higher consciousness.  There are many, many ascended masters - Jesus, the Buddha, Krishna, Saint Germain, the Archangels, etc.  The link below has a list, with information about each one. I work primarily with Lady Nada, Mary Magdalene, and Charity.  At least, these are the ones who most frequently appear in my healing work.</p>
        <p>You are more than welcome to communicate with ascended masters using energy testing, and ask specific ones if they are willing to work with you, or ask all of them if any are willing to work with you, and determine who they are.</p>
