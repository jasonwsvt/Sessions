            <b><u>Determination:</u></b>
            <br>The process of using energy testing to find all the reasons that underlie an issue.

        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Resolution:</b>
            <br>The use of energy testing to clear sufficiently determined reasons for an issue.
