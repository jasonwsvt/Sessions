        <h1>So what does this actually look like?</h1>
        <p>
            A quick example:
            <br>Issue: I don’t like creating this presentation.  It’s a whole lot of work and it might end up being a waste of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reasons (3):
            <br>Deprivation
            <br>Deep level recurrent wariness
            <br>I’m worried no one will find interest in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I’m checking to see if the original issue is still true.  It’s not.
            <br>Is the inverse true?  I do like creating this presentation.  It’s not a whole lot of work and it might end up being worth it.  Yes, that’s true.
            <br>Now the following tests true: I do like creating this presentation.  It’s not a whole lot of work and it might end up being worth it.
            <br>Don’t worry if you didn’t completely understand everything.  That’s what the rest of this presentation is for.
