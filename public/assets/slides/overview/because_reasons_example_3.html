        <h1>So what does this actually look like?</h1>
        <p>A quick example:</p>
        <p>Issue: I don’t like creating this presentation.  It’s a whole lot of work and it might end up being a waste of time.</p>
        <p>Reasons (3):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Deprivation (I feel deprived by the amount of time it's taking, which I could be using for other things.)</li>
            <li>Deep level recurrent wariness (At a very deep level, I question how necessary it is that I need write this presentation.)</li>
            <li>I’m worried no one will find interest in it.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Now I’m checking to see if the original issue is still true.  It’s not.</p>
        <p>Is the inverse true?  I do like creating this presentation.  It’s not too much work and it might end up being worth it.  Yes, that’s true.</p>
        <p>Don’t worry if you didn’t completely understand everything.  That’s what the rest of this presentation is for.</p>
