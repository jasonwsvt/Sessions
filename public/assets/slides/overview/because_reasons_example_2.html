        <h1>So what does this actually look like?</h1>
        <p>
            A quick example:
            <br>Issue: "I don’t like creating this presentation.  It’s a whole lot of work and it might end up being a waste of time."
        </p>
        <p>Now I need to determine all the reasons and the components of each one.  Holding the issue in mind, I try to feel the issue as strongly as possible.  No holds barred.  I don't rationalize it away.  I don't think about how I have such a strong drive to complete it, and how important I feel the work is to complete.  I just think about how hard it is to organize everything, and to explain concepts in ways that everyone will understand.</p>
        <p>Using energy testing I first determine the number of reasons.  There tend to be fewer then ten or so reasons, so I start with "more than five", and this is false.  "Less than five" returns true.  "One" and "two" return false, and "three" returns true.  So now I know there are three reasons.</p>
        <p>To determine the first reason, I first determine that it has one component.  I then go through my list and it takes me a few seconds to find that component: deprivation.  I feel deprived by the amount of time it's taking, which I could be using for other things.  Since it’s true, I should be able to clear it.  The resolution request responds with true, so I know it cleared successfully.</p>
        <p>I determine the second reason to have three components. 1) Deep level, 2) recurrent, and 3) wariness.  And it resonates with me: at a very deep level, I question how necessary it is that I need write this presentation.  The three components of the reason test true, so I’m attempting to clear it now.  The request for resolution comes back true, so I know it cleared successfully.</p>
        <p>And the third reason just came to me with intuition: I’m worried no one will find interest in it.  It energy tests true so I’m attempting to clear it.  And now it's cleared.</p>
