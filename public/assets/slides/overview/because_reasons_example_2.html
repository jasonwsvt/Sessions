        <h1>So what does this actually look like?</h1>
        <p>
            A quick example:
            <br>Issue: I don’t like creating this presentation.  It’s a whole lot of work and it might end up being a waste of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reasons (3):
            <br>Deprivation
            <br>Deep level recurrent wariness
            <br>I’m worried no one will find interest in it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alright.  Now we’re in to the determination and resolution process.
            <br>Let’s look for all the underlying reasons.
            <br>How many are there?  Looks like there are three.
            <br>I’m determining the first one…  Deprivation tests true.  I’ll go into how I do this later.
            <br>Since it’s true I can clear it.  And it’s now cleared.
            <br>The second is … Deep level … recurrent … wariness.  I’m clearing it now.
            <br>And the third is … I’m worried no one will find interest in it.  I found that one using intuition, just closely observing my feelings.  It’s sufficiently true so I’m clearing it now.
