        <h1>What is Because Reasons?</h1>
        <p>Because Reasons is an energy psychology method that uses energy testing to determine and resolve issues.</p>
        <p>Its namesake is a slang term that one may say to avoid specifying actual reasons, implicitly because they're embarrassing, complicated, private, revealing, offensive, uncertain, or unknown.</p>
        <p>The name is meant as somewhat of a quadruple entendre:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Someone may not want to tell someone else about an issue they're experiencing.<br><span style = "text-align: right;">Person 1: <i>Why don't you like clowns?</i> Person 2: <i>Ugh... Because reasons.</i><br></span></li>
            <li>Issues have underlying reasons.<br><span style = "text-align: right !important;">Person 1: <i>Why do you have this issue?</i> Person 2: <i>Because reasons.</i></span><br></li>
            <li>As I will explain later, this method helps someone figure out all the reasons for issues they experience.<br><span style = "text-align: right !important;">Person 1: <i>Why do you have this issue?</i> Person 2: <i>Because reasons!</i></li>
            <li>As I will explain later, this method helps someone clear all the reasons for issues they experience.<br><span style = "text-align: right !important;">Person 1: <i>You don't have that issue any more!  Why's that?</i> Person 2: <i>Because Reasons!</i></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>To best explain the concepts of issues, energy testing, determination, and resolution, I've divided them up into four different levels: overview, beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  Any reader should be able to stop after any level and be fairly confident in their ability to practice and use Because Reasons at that level.  The remaining slides in this level will cover the very basics of each of these concepts.</p>
