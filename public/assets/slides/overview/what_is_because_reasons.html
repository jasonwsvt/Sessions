        <h1>What is Because Reasons?</h1>
        <p><i>Because Reasons</i> is an energy psychology method that uses energy testing to determine and resolve issues.</p>
        <p>To best explain the concepts of issues, energy testing, determination, and resolution, I've divided them up into four different levels:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>overview - a one-slide synopsis of each concept,</li>
            <li>beginner - tangible things that everone is familiar with,</li>
            <li>intermediate - well-understood concepts in the field of subtle energy, and</li>
            <li>advanced - things I've discerned that that aren't very well understood but still contribute to healing.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Any reader should be able to stop after any level and be fairly confident in their ability to practice Because Reasons at that level.</p>
        <p>The remaining slides in this level will cover the very basics of each of these concepts.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Its namesake is a slang term that one may say to avoid specifying actual reasons, implicitly because they're embarrassing, complicated, too revealing, offensive, uncertain, or unknown.</p>
        <p>It's meant as somewhat of a quadruple entendre:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Someone may not want to tell someone else about an issue they're experiencing.
                <br><span>Person 1: <i>Why are you so afraid of clowns?</i> Person 2: <i>Ugh... Because reasons.</i><br></span></li>
            <li>As I will explain later, issues exist as a consequence of their underlying reasons.
                <br><span>Person 1: <i>Why are you so afraid of clowns?</i> Person 2: <i>Because reasons.</i></span></li>
            <li>As I will explain later, this method helps someone discover all the unknown or unclear reasons for why they experience an issue.
                <br><span>Person 1: <i>Why are you so afraid of clowns?</i> Person 2: <i>Because reasons!</i></span></li>
            <li>As I will explain later, this method helps someone clear all the reasons for issues they experience.
                <br><span>Person 1: <i>Hey, you aren't afraid of clowns anymore!  Why's that?</i> Person 2: <i>Because Reasons!</i></span></li>
        </ol>
