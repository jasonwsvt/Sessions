        <h1>What is Because Reasons?</h1>
        <p>Because Reasons is an energy psychology method that uses energy testing to determine and resolve issues.</p>
        <p>To best explain the concepts of issues, energy testing, determination, and resolution, I've divided them up into four different levels: overview, beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  Any reader should be able to stop after any level and be fairly confident in their ability to practice and use Because Reasons at that level.  The remaining slides in this level will cover the very basics of each of these concepts.</p>
