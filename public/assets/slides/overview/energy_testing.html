        <h1>Overview - Energy Testing</h1>
        <p>What you say, think, or feel, will cause various muscles in your body to temporarily strengthen or weaken, depending on how harmonious it is to your subconscious.  This muscular response always occurs, regardless of whether you're aware of it, and simply put, it can always be translated as true (harmonious) or false (disharmonious).</p>
        <p>Energy testing (also called applied kinesiology, manual muscle testing, or just muscle testing), is the practice of focusing on a specific thought, feeling, sensation, or substance, and observing the natural muscular response in a specific way.  Despite being dismissed as pseudoscience by the orthodox scientific community, it's considered a very useful and effective tool in many well-respected practices - psychology, chiropractics, nutrition, etc.</p>
        <p>There are many different energy testing methods, and if you know one already, it will certainly work with Because Reasons.  I will go over a brief history of energy testing, as well as the method I use, in the next level.</p>
