        <h1>Overview - Energy Testing</h1>
        <p>What you say, think, or feel, will cause various muscles in your body to temporarily strengthen or weaken, depending on how harmonious it is to your subconscious.</p>
        <p>This muscular response always occurs, regardless of whether you're aware of it, and it can usually be translated as true (harmonious) or false (disharmonious).</p>
        <p>Energy testing (also called applied kinesiology, manual muscle testing, or just muscle testing), is the practice of focusing on a specific thought, feeling, sensation, or substance, and observing the natural muscular response in a specific way.</p>
        <p>Despite being dismissed as pseudoscience by the orthodox scientific community, it's considered a very useful and effective tool in many well-respected fields, like psychology, chiropractics, and nutrition.</p>
        <p>There are many different energy testing methods, and if you know one already, it will certainly work with Because Reasons.</p>
        <p>I will go over a brief history of energy testing, as well as the method I use, in the next level.</p>
