        <h1>Overview - Issues</h1>
        <p>Issues are collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict.  These issues come in the form of triggers, trauma, physical pain, and negative thoughts.  Examples include headaches, thoughts of inadequacy, and feelings like sadness.  In the next level I will go into further detail on what internally conflicting sensations, thoughts, and feelings, are.  I will also explain the concepts of identification and secondary gain, and how their presence disables energy psychology methods from working.</p>
