        <h1>Overview - Issues</h1>
        <p>Issues are collections of sensations, thoughts, behaviors, and feelings, that cause internal conflict.</p>
        <p>These issues come in many forms, including triggers, trauma, physical pain, and negative thoughts.</p>
        <p>Examples include headaches, thoughts of inadequacy, and feelings like sadness.</p>
        <p>In the next level I will go into further detail on what I mean by internal conflict.</p>
        <p>I will also explain the concepts of identification and resistance, and how their presence disables energy psychology methods from working.</p>
