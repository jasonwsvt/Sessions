        <h1>Overview - Issues</h1>
        <p>I'm describing issues as "collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict.  These issues come in the form of triggers, trauma, physical pain, and negative thoughts.  Examples include headaches, thoughts of inadequacy, feelings like sadness.  Identification plays a large role, as when an issue is identified with, an energy psychology technique cannot clear it.  Secondary gain also plays a large role, as when one believes it's better with an issue than without, it also cannot be cleared.</p>
