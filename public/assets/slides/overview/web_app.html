        <ul>
            <li>From top to bottom, the app is divided into three sections - a utility toolbar, an editor, and a set of component buttons.</li>
            <li>The utilities on left of the toolbar are divided into four sections on the left - user, clients, issues, and sessions.
                <br>The three buttons on the right are to adjust the heights of the editor and component buttons sections, and load the instructions.
            </li>
            <li>Most people will not concern themselves with the client utility, and the only client they will ever work on is "Self."</li>
            <li>A user can work with multiple clients, each client can have multiple issues, and each issue is worked on in multiple sessions.</li>
            <li>The client, issue, and session sections each have an entry selection menu.
                <br>By default, the client selection menu button shows Self, and the issue selection menu button shows "New Issue."  Any new client will have a default name of "New Client."
                <br>The selection menu button for the sessions section shows the time the selected session was created.</li>
            <li>The session menu shows all the sessions for the currently selected issue, so when a different issue is selected, the entries update in the session selection menu.</li>
            <li>The rename button (<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-pencil-square" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

            <li>The editor is where the reasons for the currently selected session are shown and entered.

            <li>The component buttons section is divided into button groups on the left, and the list of component buttons on the right.
                <br>Clicking a button group will scroll the component button list to that section.
                <br>Clicking a component button will add that component at the cursor location in the editor.</li>
