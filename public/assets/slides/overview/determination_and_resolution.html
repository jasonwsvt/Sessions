        <h1>Overview - Determination and Resolution</h1>
        <p>Recall that issues are collections of sensations, thoughts, behaviors, and feelings, that cause internal conflict, and energy testing is the observation of a specific natural response in the body to controlled stimuli.</p>
        <p>In Because Reasons, energy testing is used for determining four things:<ol>
                <li>the number of reasons an issue has, and the number of components for each reason,</li>
                <li>what each component is,</li>
                <li>whether or not everything is sufficiently determined, and</li>
                <li>whether or not resolution of the issue and its components was successful.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Determination of issue components can be likened to a game of Twenty Questions, where one uses energy testing, their intuition, and a list of potential components, to figure out the components for each reasons.  Usually an issue has only a couple or few reasons, a reason only has a couple or so components, and the whole process generally takes seconds or minutes.</p>
        <p>Resolution is a special command to the subconscious, and it's really nothing more than the clear intent to release an issue.  The energy tested response to the resolution command is, as with all other energy tested responses, either true or false, and this response indicates whether or not the resolution was a success or if there is more to determine.</p>
        <p>In the next levels I will present some concepts and information that will aid in the determination process.  I will also explain methods that should remove a significant amount of guesswork, and assist you in fairly quickly determining the components of any issue.</p>
