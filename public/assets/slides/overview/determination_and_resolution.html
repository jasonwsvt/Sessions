        <h1>Overview - Determination and Resolution</h1>
        <p>Recall that issues are collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict, and energy testing is the observation of a specific natural response in the body to controlled stimuli.</p>
        <p>In Because Reasons, energy testing is used for three things: determining what the components of an issue are, whether or not components are sufficiently determined, and requesting resolution of the components and the issue itself.</p>
        <p>Determination of issue components can be likened to a game of Twenty Questions, where one uses their intuition and a chart of potential components figure out all the reasons.  Usually an issue has only a few reasons, and the whole process generally takes seconds or minutes.</p>
        <p>Resolution is a special command to the subconscious, and it's really nothing more than the clear intent to release the issue.  The energy tested response to the resolution command is, as with all other energy tested responses, either true or false, and this response indicates whether or not the resolution was a success or if there is more to determine.</p>
        <p>In the next levels I will present some lists and explain methods that should remove a significant amount of guesswork, and assist you in fairly quickly determining the components of any issue.</p>
