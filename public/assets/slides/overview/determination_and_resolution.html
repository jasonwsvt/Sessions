        <h1>Overview - Determination and Resolution</h1>
        <p>Recall that issues are collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict, and energy testing is the observation of a specific natural response in the body to controlled stimuli.</p>
        <p>In Because Reasons, energy testing is used for three things: determining what the components of an issue are, whether or not components are sufficiently determined, and resolution of the issue.</p>
        <p>Resolution is a special command to the subconscious, and it's really nothing more than the clear intent to release the issue.  The energy tested response to the resolution command is, as with all other energy tested responses, either true or false, and this response indicates whether or not the resolution was a success or if there is more to determine.</p>
        <p>This whole process is somewhat similar to the game, Twenty Questions, but in the next levels I will explain some methods that should remove a significant amount of guesswork, and assist you in fairly quickly determining the components of any issue.</p>
