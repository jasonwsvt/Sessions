        <h1>So what does this actually look like?</h1>
        <p>One tends to begin a Because Reasons session because they recognize something that exists in their experience that they don't want to experience anymore.</p>
        <p>I'll give you an example.  While I was writing these instructions, they originally took the form of notes, then a book, then a website, then a presentation, then as a video of that presentation, and now as a web application.  In each state, the content was clarified, organized in improved ways, and provided better examples.</p>
        <p>While I was writing the presentation, it went through a significant overhaul and at one point I felt all the work that still needed to be done was overwhelming.  I also had absolutely no idea whether anything would come of it.</p>
        <p>So hey, we now have an issue, and I wrote it down as best as I could word it:</p>
        <p>"I don’t like creating this presentation.  It’s a whole lot of work and it might end up being a waste of time."</p>
        <p>The first step would be to energy test whether the issue is true, so I use my energy testing method to test the truthfulness of this issue to my subconsciousness.</p>
        <p>So how does this statement energy test?  True.</p>
