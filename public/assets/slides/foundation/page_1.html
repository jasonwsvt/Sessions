        <p>The following is a working model - what I feel is the basis for my understanding of how the energy psychology method I have been developing since 2009 (the Complex Issue Resolution Technique, or CIRT for short) actually works.</p>
        <p>Every time a thought enters your experience, you have two options: identify with it, or recognize it and let it go.  Either way, you might choose to react to it somehow, but that's not really in the scope of this essay.  When you identify with it, its energy attaches to you.  Every thought can be healthy or unhealthy, and if an unhealthy thought is identified with, it becomes an issue.</p>
        <p>What do I mean by an issue?  Triggers, limiting beliefs, thoughts, and physical and emotional discomfort and pain are things that I have released with this method.  By that I mean I have used my method with multiple issues of each of these types, and have observed the prompt ending of each of those issues.</p>
        <p>For example, "the world is a scary place" can be perceived in many different ways, some more unhealthy than others.  If someone grows up continually identifying with a particularly unhealthy version of this thought, hundreds or thousands of times, to the point where it pervades every fiber of their being, those thoughts would eventually manifest symptomatically as a physical or emotional issue.</p>
