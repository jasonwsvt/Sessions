        <p>Energy testing allows the tester to communicate with their subconscious - the portion of yourself that is not conscious - and could be thought of as your bodymind, higher self, soul, or spirit.  The specifics of different energy testing methods vary significantly, but generally speaking they include holding in mind a statement or thought, and recognizing a muscular response that indicates "true" or "false", representing how harmonious the thing being tested is with respect to everything you’ve identified with.</p>
        <p>Energy testing is dismissed by the orthodox scientific community because responses to energy tests are heavily influenced by any beliefs the practitioner might consciously or unconsciously hold about the thing being tested.  However, this influence is precisely what needs to be tested in the case of issue specification.  One way to get around this influence is to test things for which there is no influence by any beliefs, and this is particularly useful for the determination of what’s necessary to clear an issue.</p>
