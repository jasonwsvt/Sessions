        <p>Once an issue is sufficiently determined, the next step is to use energy testing to determine the exact “code” needed to release it.  This code is usually made up of between zero and four segments, and each segment usually has between one and seven components.  Similar to issue specification, the list I mentioned earlier can be used to determine these components, and there’s absolutely no need to understand what the code means or how it works.  As long as the code segment tests true, and you intend the release of the associated thoughts, the thoughts release.</p>
        <p>From what I understand of the point of view of the subconscious, an issue often consists of anywhere from a hundred to something like ten billion thoughts.  It would be very inconvenient to have to consciously clear them one at a time.  To get around this, the subconscious is capable of finding a portion of thoughts within the issue that collectively has a particular energy signature.  It then determines a set of components (a code segment) that will produce that signature when determined by the practitioner.  The practitioner then determines the components and the associated thoughts can then be released through intention.  Once all the code segments are determined and associated thoughts are released, the issue is released as well.</p>
