        <p>Limited to only things like triggers, limiting beliefs, thoughts, and physical and emotional pain, I believe this method is invaluable, but I'm also inclined to believe it can release at least some types of disease, though I have not had a chance to test it on such things since the method has solidified in the last couple years.  On three occasions I've used this method to end the pain caused by bee stings.  The theory of thoughts causing issues also seems to break down a bit for this example, but nevertheless, I've recognized a distinct correlation between using the method on a bee sting and the abatement of pain.  In any case...</p>
        <p>There are different ways to define the dividing line between healthy and unhealthy.  A simple way is whether or not something is accepted or rejected, or basically how much its existence is resisted.  If you accept a thought, a feeling, an experience, a perception, whatever, you can think of it as healthy.  If you reject or resist something, it’s unhealthy.  And it’s a spectrum - the stronger you feel that acceptance or rejection, the more healthy or unhealthy it is.  In case you’re wondering, it’s entirely possible to disagree with something, or not desire something, and feel no resistance to or rejection for that thing.  To be entirely clear, it’s not the thing being resisted, but the resistance itself, that makes an identified thought unhealthy.</p>
        <p>A single identified unhealthy thought usually isn't a big deal, but when an issue already exists, and an unhealthy thought associated with that issue is identified with, they attach to each other.  In this way they can become quite large, relatively speaking, and the larger an issue, the greater the health problems it causes can become.</p>
