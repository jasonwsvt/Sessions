        <p>Your subconscious is you.  As you, it knows everything about you.  As your higher self, it knows infinitely more.  One could think of their subconscious as their best friend, mentor, and confidante.  Despite the limitation in communication your subconscious has in responding to you, there is no real limitation with you communicating with it.  It’s absolutely unnecessary to communicate with it like a company’s interactive voice response answering machine.</p>
        <p>Issue specification is the process of starting with a statement that’s representative of an issue, and adjusting the words contained in the statement until it energy tests sufficiently true.  Perhaps you’re starting out with “the world is a scary place” but end up with “the world is a really scary place.”  You might even end up with a second issue - “the world is an extremely scary place.”  Each adjustment can be quickly determined from a list I’ve painstakingly developed through trial and error since 2009.</p>
