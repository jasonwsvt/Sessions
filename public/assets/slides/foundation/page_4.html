        <p>Another way to duplicate an unhealthy thought or issue is by describing it with words.  Using reason and intuition, one can get pretty close to the exact words needed to describe an issue, and once it's described at a sufficient level of accuracy, all that's needed to release it is intention.  However, I would venture to say that consistently attaining a sufficient level of accuracy using reason and intuition alone is pretty much impossible.</p>
        <p>When you specify an issue, a portion of the thoughts associated with it will enter a state where they can be released.  The percentage of thoughts increases with the accuracy of the specification.  Intuition and reason can only go so far in this process.  So how can a sufficient amount of accuracy be achieved when specifying an issue?  A method called energy testing (which includes pendling and manual muscle testing) makes this process of issue determination not only possible, but relatively easy, and opens up a door to healing that I would venture to say is not possible without it.</p>
