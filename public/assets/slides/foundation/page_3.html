        <p>Issues are recognized when you have the realization that something in your experience is not something you want.  Issues can be released in basically the same way they're generated, with two necessary differences.  First, one must bring a thought into consciousness that is nearly identical to the original.  Second, the intention must be of de-identification or release (not rejection, as that is identification with the rejection of the issue).  In short, releasing consists of duplicating the thought with the intention of releasing it.  Once all the thoughts for an issue are released, the issue goes away.</p>
        <p>One can remember to accurately recognize and release an unhealthy thought the moment it is experienced.  This is effective for that thought, disabling it from attaching to any associated issue if one exists.  But if this thought is similar to those you've identified with before, how do you clear that issue in its entirety?  Duplicating a previously experienced unhealthy thought with the intention of releasing it is certainly possible without doing anything special, but it can be difficult to get everything exactly the same for every single one.</p>
