            <li>Write down a symptom or aspiration.
                <br>If you like, you could figure one out using energy testing.</li>
            <li>Energy test if there’s a reason.
                <br>You could test the number of remaining reasons but it might change.</li>
            <li>Determine the number of components for the reason.</li>
            <li>For each component, determine the type (psychological reversal, emotion, event aspect (when, where, who, what, why, how, etc.), physical body, sense, energy system, low level energy, characteristic (of others, extranormal level, negation, etc.), or something else).</li>
            <li>Once the reason’s components are determined, resolve the reason.
                <br>It might need to be put in the form of a statement.</li>
            <li>If a reason doesn’t resolve, it has one or more underlying reasons.
                <br>Indent and go back to step 2 to determine them!</li>
            <li>If the reason does resolve, go back to step 2 to see if there’s another.</li>
            <li>When you clear the original issue you’re done with the round!
                <br>If you like, start another round by going back to step 1!</li>
