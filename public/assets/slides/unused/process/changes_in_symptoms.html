        <h1>Process - Changes in Symptoms</h1>
        <p>Certain symptoms may be present at the onset of energy work, and periodically adjust after the clearing of a reason.  This is most typical, or at least recognizable, in the case of physical sensations, so Iâ€™ll use this as an example.  Imagine having a sharp pain in the neck.  After a few reasons are cleared, the sharpness may have reduced, and the location may have changed to your upper back.  After another few reasons are cleared, the pain may completely clear.  Even though no sensations are recognized, be sure to check for any remaining reasons.</p>
