        <h1>Issues - Identification</h1>
        <p>
            Identification is when one believes something isn’t an issue when it really is.  If an issue is identified with, it does not cause internal conflict, and can not be cleared, but it’s still unhealthy and can still lead to lack of health.

            For example, one may feel an issue is that of someone else, and the despair, anger, disgust, dislike, or whatever else they feel in reaction to it is perfectly reasonable.  In other words, they’ve identified with it.  Not to discount the actions of the other person, but reactions like these are unhealthy as well.
