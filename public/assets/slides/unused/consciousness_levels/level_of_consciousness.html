        <h1>Issue Determination - A Definition:</h1>
        <p>As you may have already recognized, there seems to be an implicit connection between consciousness level and emotion.  But generally speaking, every thought, action, and thing has a consciousness level.  So this includes people, places, organizations, parts of the body, behavioral patterns, and psychological reversals.  Just about the only thing that doesn't have a consciousness level are senses.  Consciousness levels are especially convenient when determining emotions as we will see.  Otherwise, they aren’t required for sufficient determination all that often.</p>
        <p>Hawkins uses the term “level of consciousness” to describe a certain quality of a person, people, or their beliefs, actions, or creations, but as far as I can tell, there is not an explicit definition for it.  I would like to provide the following one:</p>
        <p>Consciousness level:</p>
        <p>“The breadth of inclusiveness of the worldview from which consciousness is expressed.”</p>
        <p>By this I mean that the consciousness level of someone or something is directly correlated with their expressed or represented acceptance of, and identity with, other.</p>
