        <p>You may find that after enough conscious initiation of issue resolution, many issues will automatically resolve the moment you sufficiently determine them, or even bring them into consciousness, without the need to explicitly command resolution, or possibly even determine them at all.</p>
        <p>Components tend to group.  For example, initially reasons may present with conjunctions, then individually, then grouped (e.g. all emotions in the Fear group - 100-108 or 100-124), to everything within a type of component (e.g. all psychological reversals), to different component types being grouped together (e.g. all emotions and psychological reversals as a single group).</p>
