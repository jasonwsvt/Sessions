        <p>In review, here are the basic step for gameplay of Because Reasons.  </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write down an issue.
                <br>If you like, you could figure one out using energy testing.</li>
            <li>Energy test if there’s a reason.
                <br>You could test the number of remaining reasons but it might change.</li>
            <li>Determine the number of components for the reason.</li>
            <li>For each component, determine the type (part of the physical body, sense, emotion, psychological reversal, or pattern)</li>
            <li>Once the reason’s components are determined, resolve the reason.
                <br>It might need to be put in the form of a statement.</li>
            <li>If a reason doesn’t resolve, it has one or more underlying reasons.
                <br>Indent and go back to step 2 to determine them!</li>
            <li>If the reason does resolve, go back to step 2 to see if there’s another.</li>
            <li>When you clear the original issue you’re done with the round!
                <br>If you like, start another round by going back to step 1!</li>
        </ol>
