        <p>In review, here are the basic steps for gameplay of Because Reasons.  </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write down an issue.</li>
            <li>Energy test if there’s a reason.
                <br>You could test the number of remaining reasons but it might change.</li>
            <li>Determine the number of components for the reason.</li>
            <li>For each component, determine the type (part of the physical body, a sense, an emotion, or a psychological reversal).</li>
            <li>Once the reason’s components are determined, resolve the reason.
                <br>It might need to be put in the form of a statement.</li>
            <li>If the reason resolves, go back to step 2 to see if there’s another.</li>
            <li>If not, it has one or more underlying reasons.
                <br>Indent and go back to step 2 to determine them!</li>
            <li>When you clear the original issue you’re done with the round!
                <br>If you like, start another round by going back to step 1!</li>
        </ol>
