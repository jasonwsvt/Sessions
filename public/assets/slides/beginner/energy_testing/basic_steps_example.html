        <h1>Energy Testing - A Simple Example</h1>
        <p>Consider the declarative statement, “my name is Jason.”</p>

        <ol>
            <li>First I focus on the statement, “my name is Jason.”</li>
            <li>Next, I perform the test with the energy testing method I use.</li>
            <li>Finally, I observe the response to the energy test - True.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p>Since I know my name is Jason, I was certain of the response before I did the energy test, but just like anything else, I receive a true response because it is harmonic with what my subconscious knows to be true about myself.</p>
