        <h1>Energy Testing - Scientific Basis</h1>
        <p>The hard truth is that energy testing is regarded as pseudoscience by the orthodox scientific community due to it being difficult to clinically reproduce results.</p>
        <p>That said, it has found significant inroads into psychotherapy, chiropractics, naturopathic medicine, energy psychology, and other respected fields.</p>
        <p>So even though energy testing does not test well, it is successfully used in several professional fields to bring about healing.</p>
        <p>It seems like the takeaway is to not expect scientifically reproducible results, or even for the results to always make sense.</p>
        <p>What is important is the techniqueâ€™s usability and efficacy, and there are plenty of users of energy testing who find it very effective in their healing work.</p>
