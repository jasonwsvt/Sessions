        <h1>Energy Testing - Truth and Falsity</h1>
        <p>Everything you energy test is responded to with either true, false, or something else that might be unclear.</p>
        <p>We’ll cover what to do in the case of unclear responses later.</p>
        <p>The best things to energy test are either implicitly or explicitly in the form of a declarative statement.</p>
        <p>For example, instead of energy testing a question, like "what emotion am I feeling?", it’s best to actually test the statement, "the emotion I'm feeling is …"</p>
        <p>You can then test a single emotion, or narrow down a range of emotions from the list I’ll provide later until only one tests true.</p>
