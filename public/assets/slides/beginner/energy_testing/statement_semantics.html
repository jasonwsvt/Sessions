        <h1>Energy Testing - Statement Semantics</h1>
        <p>Consider the following statement:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">“I never said they stole my money.”</p>
        <p>The meaning of this statement changes depending on which words have emphasis.</p>
        <p>Consider the implication of saying it in one of the following ways:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">“I never <i>said</i> they stole my money.”</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">“I never said <i>they</i> stole my money.”</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">“I never said they stole my <i>money</i>.”</p>
        <p>Similar consideration must be taken when putting together statements to energy test.</p>
