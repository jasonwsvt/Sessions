        <h1>Energy Testing - Avoiding Influence</h1>
        <p>Any desires or beliefs you have regarding the truth or falsity of a statement can and do influence the energy tested response.</p>
        <p>So itâ€™s really important to not influence the results with your desires and beliefs.</p>
        <p>I call this getting out of your own way.</p>
        <p>You might need to begin testing with something like "In the name of the highest good" in order to increase the accuracy of an answer.</p>
