        <p>There are three basic steps to energy testing.</p>

        <table>
            <tr><th>Step</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1) Focus on the thing you want to energy test.</td><td>This could be a statement, belief, feeling, or substance.<br>Do not energy test questions.  The response tp an energy tested question is based on how harmonious the question itself is to your subconscious, and not the answer to the question.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2) Perform the test using the method of your choosing.</td><td>Iâ€™ll explain the method I use shortly.  If you already use or would like to use another method instead, there are plenty of resources available online.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3) Observe and interpret the response to the energy test.</td><td>The true and false responses for energy tests should be very clear, regardless of which method you use.</td></tr>
