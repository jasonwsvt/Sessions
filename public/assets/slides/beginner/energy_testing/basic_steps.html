        <h1>Energy Testing - Basic Steps</h1>
        <p>There are three basic steps to energy testing.</p>

        <table>
            <tr><th>Step</th><th>Comments</th></tr>
            <tr><td>1) Focus on the thing you want to energy test.</td><td>This could be a statement, belief, feeling, or substance.<br>Do not energy test questions.  The response to an energy tested question is based on how harmonious the question itself is to your subconscious, and not the answer to the question.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2) Perform the test using the method of your choosing.</td><td>You can use the eye method I just explained, or one you are familiar with already.  If you aren't familiar with any, and would prefer to learn one that's more common, I recommend searching online for <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=self+muscle+testing+methods">self muscle testing methods</a>, doing a little research, and choosing one you prefer.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3) Observe and interpret the response to the energy test.</td><td>The true and false responses for energy tests should be very clear, regardless of which method you use.</td></tr>
