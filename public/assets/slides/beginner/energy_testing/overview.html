        <h1>Energy Testing - Overview</h1>
        <p>What you say, think, or feel will cause various muscles to temporarily strengthen or weaken, depending on how harmonious or disharmonious it is to your subconscious.</p>
        <p>Your body is always naturally responding to these stimuli in ways that can be tested, regardless of whether you're consciously testing or looking for these responses.</p>
        <p>Energy testing is the conscious act of observing these natural responses in the body to controlled stimuli.</p>
        <p>I consider muscle testing similar to energy testing, as they can both be used to determine whether a statement is true or false, but they're a little different in a fundamental way.</p>
        <p>While energy testing is the observation of an involuntary muscle contraction, muscle testing is the recognition of a variance in strength of a muscle being acted upon by a force.</p>
        <p>I use the term energy testing throughout the instructions, but muscle testing should also be able to be used in most if not all cases.</p>
        <p>In any case, Because Reasons is a process of determination and resolution of issues using energy testing.</p>
        <p>For the remainder of this section I'll go over the fundamentals of energy testing.</p>
