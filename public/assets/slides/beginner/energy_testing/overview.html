        <h1>Energy Testing - Overview</h1>
        <p>What you say, think, or feel will cause various muscles to temporarily strengthen or weaken, depending on how harmonious or disharmonious it is to your subconscious.</p>
        <p>Your body is always naturally responding to these stimuli in ways that can be tested, regardless of whether you're consciously looking for these responses.</p>
        <p>Several methods exist where a person holds a substance close to their body or focuses on a thought, and then in a way that's particular to the method, observes whether a muscle in their body becomes strong or weak.</p>
        <p>Muscle testing methods require applying a force to such a muscle, and depending on whether the muscle is strong or weak, a partical result will occur.</p>
        <p>I believe the most familar method is one in which one person holds out their arm and resists a force that a second person applies to it.</p>
        <p>There are similar self muscle testing methods (not requiring a partner) that use muscles in the fingers.</p>
        <p>There is another self muscle testing method where one observes whether they sway forward or backward.</p>
        <p>Energy testing is the direct observation of an involuntary contraction of the musclethe strength or weakness in the muscle.</p>
        <p>The only energy testing method I'm familiar with is my own, where I observe involuntary contractions of muscles near my left eye.</p>
        <p>I use the term energy testing throughout the instructions, but muscle testing should also be able to be used in most if not all cases.</p>
        <p>In any case, I describe Because Reasons as a process of determination and resolution of issues using energy testing.</p>
        <p>For the remainder of this section I'll go over basic concepts that can be applied to both muscle testing and energy testing and how it's used in Because Reasons, as well as describe the method I use.</p>
