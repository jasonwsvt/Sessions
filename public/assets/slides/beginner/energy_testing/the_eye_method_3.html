        <h1>Energy Testing - The Eye Method</h1>
        <p>While paying attention to the muscles around your eyes, think or say “show me a true” and “show me a false” several times.  Focus on directing the request to your subconscious.  Don’t focus on what, if anything, you expect to happen.</p>
        <p>As you continue doing this you will start noticing a specific response for each: a subtle, involuntary muscle contraction, shortly after you say the statement.</p>
        <p>Keep practicing and the responses will become more and more evident.</p>
