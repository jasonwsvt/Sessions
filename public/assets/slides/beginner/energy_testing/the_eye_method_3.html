        <h1>Energy Testing - The Eye Method</h1>
        <p>While paying attention to the muscles around your eyes, think or say “show me a true” and “show me a false” several times.</p>
        <p>Focus on directing the request to your subconscious.</p>
        <p>Don’t focus on what, if anything, you expect to happen.</p>
        <p>As you continue doing this you will start noticing a specific response for each: a subtle, involuntary muscle contraction, shortly after you say the statement.</p>
        <p>The location where you sense the response for "show me a true" will always be exactly the same.</p>
        <p>The same is true for the response for "show me a false," but at a different location.</p>
        <p>Keep practicing and the responses will become more and more evident.</p>
