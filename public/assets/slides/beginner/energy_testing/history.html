        <h1>Energy Testing - History</h1>
        <p>Starting in 1964, Applied Kinesiology came about from the work of Dr. George Goodheart, who found that healthful stimuli would strengthen certain muscles, and unhealthy stimuli would cause them to weaken.
        <p>In the late 1970s, Behavioral Kinesiology came about from the work of Dr. John Diamond who took Applied Kinesiology further by observing responses of the same muscles with positive or negative physical, emotional, or intellectual stimuli.</p>
        <p>Dr. David Hawkins utilized Applied and Behavioral Kinesiology with anabolic and catabolic stimuli, as well as truth and falsity.</p>
        <p>Energy testing in Because Reasons is based on the work of Dr. Hawkins.</p>
