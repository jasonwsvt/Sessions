        <h1>Energy Testing - The Eye Method</h1>
        <p>All energy testing methods, both self- and partner-based, require testing the strength of a muscle.</p>
        <p>Typically this involves attepmting to resist of a force, and observing the difference in strength in the shoulder muscle, or in muscles in the hands.</p>
        <p>I use a self testing method that my psychotherapist taught me in 2009 in which I observe responses in muscles around my eyes.</p>
        <p>This method is different from typical ones in that it requires observing a subtle sensation caused by an involuntary contraction of muscles around the eyes, and involves no resistance of any force.</p>
        <p>Benefits of this method include the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hands are free for other uses.</li>
            <li>After a short period of conditioning, muscle fatigue is not an issue.</li>
            <li>More details exist in responses than just true and false.</li>
        </ul>
