        <h1>Energy Testing - The Eye Method</h1>
        <p>Most energy testing methods, both self- and partner-based, involve attepmting to resist an applied force using muscles in the shoulder, hands, or another major muscle group, and observing the difference in strength.</p>
        <p>I use a self testing method that my psychotherapist taught me in 2009 in which I pay attention near my eyes for subtle sensations caused by simple involuntary muscle contractions, and no resistance of any applied force is involved.</p>
        <p>Benefits of this method include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hands are free for other uses.</li>
            <li>After a short period of conditioning, muscle fatigue is not an issue.</li>
            <li>More details exist in responses than just true and false.</li>
            <li>With testing just consisting of observation, it's unnecessary to time a muscle test to conincide with the moment a response is anticipated.</li>
            <li>It's clear when more time is needed for one's subconscious to respond.</li>
        </ul>
