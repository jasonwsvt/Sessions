        <h1>Energy Testing - Example Statements</h1>
        <p>A little more abstract than “show me a true” and “show me a false” are statements that you know are true or false.</p>
        <p>They don’t need to be limited to facts about yourself.</p>
        <p>Here are some statements you could try.</p>
        <p>Be sure to also try the negation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>“I’m Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.”</li>
            <li>“I live at 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney, Australia.”</li>
            <li>“I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.”</li>
            <li>“I have a big head, and little arms.”</li>
            <li>“I'm one-sixteenth wolf with, you know, a little wolverine in there somewhere.”</li>
