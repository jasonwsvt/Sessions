        <h1>Determination - Events</h1>
        <p>It's often the case that an event characteristic is a component of a reason.</p>
        <p>In the Intermediate section I'll go over determination of events in more detail.</p>
        <p>Suffice to say for now, a component of any reason may be an event's characteristic, such as a time, location, involved individual, or action.</p>
