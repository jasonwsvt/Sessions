        <h1>Issue Determination - Conjunctions:</h1>
        <p>I have been able to glean a little regarding how some of these conjunctions work.  When conjunctions connect components it is like being broken.  Energy healing for conjunct terms heals them so that they are no longer broken.  While the term "and" groups two components, "&" is more of an inclusive range between the two components.  Bang (!) works with all emotions from the emotion or consciousness level specified down to 0.  At, at/above, at/between, and at/below work with one or two consciousness levels.</p>
