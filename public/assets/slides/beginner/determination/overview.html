        <h1>Issue Determination - Overview:</h1>
        <p>Weâ€™ve now covered Issues and Energy Testing, and have a fairly good basis to learn about Issue Determination.</p>
        <p>Determination is the process of using energy testing to find all the reasons that underlie an issue.</p>
        <p>Each reason is a set of connected components for an issue, and one important way they're connected is that only when determined sufficiently can the reason be completely released.</p>
        <p>On the next several slides I will detail the more tangible components that are often contained within reasons: the physical body, senses, emotions, psychological reversals, and patterns.</p>
        <p>I will also cover a simple method to locate items in lists using energy testing - Binary Search.</p>
        <p>Once a reason is sufficiently determined, it can then be released.  We'll cover the process of resolution in the next section.</p>
