        <h1>Issue Determination - Overview:</h1>
        <p>Weâ€™ve now covered Issues and Energy Testing, and have a fairly good basis to learn about Issue Determination.</p>
        <p>Determination is the process of using energy testing to find all the reasons that underlie an issue.</p>
		<p>Think of each reason as a lock, and determination as the process of molding a key that will fit it.</p>
        <p>Each reason is a set of connected components for an issue, and one important way they're connected is that only when determined sufficiently can the reason be completely released.</p>
        <p>On the next several pages within this section I will detail the more tangible components that are often contained within reasons: the physical body, senses, emotions, and psychological reversals.</p>
        <p>I will also cover a really simple method called Binary Search that uses energy testing to help locate items in lists.</p>
        <p>Once a reason is sufficiently determined, it can then be released, or resolved.  We'll cover the process of resolution in the next section.</p>
