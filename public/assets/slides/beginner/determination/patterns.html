        <h1>Issue Determination - Patterns:</h1>
        <p>Patterns are learned through life and block the ability to resolve an issueâ€™s reasons, or possibly even determine them.</p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Pattern</th><th>Description</th></tr>
            <tr><th>Thought</th><td>An idea, memory, image, or feeling.</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Belief</td><td>An opinion one has for something being right or wrong.</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Behavior</th><td>A way someone conducts themself.</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Identification</th><td>This occurs when someone does not see any separation between themself and something, like a belief or behavior, possibly to the point of being blind to its existance.</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Attachment</th><td>An emotional bond one may have with something, like a belief or behavior.  One may identify with their reason for the attachment, and not the attachment itself.</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Resistance</th><td>The reluctance one might have in accepting or recognizing they identify with or are attached to an issue.</td></tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <p>Many patterns often appear in groups for which I have provided the term "pattern stacks" (e.g. the identification with an attachment to a behavior that's based on a belief).</p>
