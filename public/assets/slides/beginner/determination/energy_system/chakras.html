        <h1>Issue Determination - Energy System - Chakras:</h1>
        <p>The first seven chakras (root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, crown) are well known, and fairly well understood, along with, to a lesser extent, the minor chakras in various locations around the body. However, not only these chakras show up in energy work, but others, from 8 to 105. While the first seven chakras seem to have very clear characteristics, and all have connections to all the others that sometimes need to be healed, I have not been able to determine the unique characteristics of the higher ones. There is apparently some significance to these seven groups of 14, but what, I'm not certain.</p>
