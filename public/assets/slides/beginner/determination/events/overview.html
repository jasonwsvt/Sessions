        <h1>Issue Determination - Events:</h1>
        <p>Events often come up for healing.  In my experience, the best method to use with events is similar to any other reason - to determine the number of underlying reasons that need to be cleared, and then determine the components of each reason.  Reasons for events usually include one or more of the following:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>Time</td><td>Individuals</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Actions</td><td>Items</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Location Types</td><td>Characteristics</td></tr>
        </table>
