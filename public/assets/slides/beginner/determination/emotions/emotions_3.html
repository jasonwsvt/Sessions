        <h1>Issue Determination - Emotions:</h1>
        <p>Many emotions show up in multiple places on the list.  What’s shown here is the most common.  For instance, confusion is listed just below Fear at consciousness level 99, but in fact it shows up at 199 (just below Courage), 249 (just below Neutrality), 309, 399, 499, 599, 699, 799, 899, and 999.  Pride is listed at 175, which is specifically a superiority type of pride in self or group.  People often get stuck here, as well as in Reason.  There are a couple other levels of Pride that show up in Love and Peace, that do not have a component of superiority.</p>
        <p>Some emotions used to come up a lot for which I've never figured out their names.  It’s possible names don’t exist for them.  One of these emotions is below death, with a consciousness level of 0, which I've nicknamed "fullstop.“  Another has a consciousness level between destructiveness and death, and yet another is between destructiveness and dread.  Horrible names like death and destructiveness should not be interpreted literally!  Think absolute shyness, not Armageddon.</p>
