        <h1>Issue Determination - Physical Body:</h1>
        <p>Any conceivable part of the physical body can be a component of an issue.  This includes but is not limited to bones, muscles, organs, the brain, and anything else in the anatomy.  If an issue has to do with a specific part of the physical body, this part is typically included in one or more of the issueâ€™s reasons.  Additionally, if there exists a problem with the physical body, energy testing should be able to determine any associated issues, and resolving those issues may result in resolution of the problem.  For me, this is often true with stiffness and pain.</p>
