        <h1>Psychological Reversals - Overview:</h1>
        <p>Traditionally, psychological reversals are excuses as to why one should keep an issue. Here is a list of sixteen psychological reversals and example diagnostic statements.</p>
        <p>This list is based on one that I was given by my psychotherapist in 2009.  Each time I have added a psychological reversal, it has been when one needed to be resolved, but it was not on the list.  Sometimes I was able to figure out what it was, and other times it was sufficient to approximate it with a combination of other psychological reversals.</p>

        <p>Many psychological reversals often appear in groups (e.g. the identification with an attachment to a behavior that's based on a belief).</p>
