        <h1>Psychological Reversals - Overview:</h1>
        <p>Psychological reversals are excuses one may have as to why one is attached or resistant to something.</p>
        <p>Here is a list of psychological reversals and example diagnostic statements.</p>
        <p>This list is based on one that I was given by my psychotherapist in 2009.</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>Belief</td><td>Deservedness</td><td>Doubt</td><td>Possibility</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Benefit</td><td>Desire</td><td>Identity</td><td>Privacy</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Capability</td><td>Deprivation</td><td>Motivation</td><td>Safety</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Contract</td><td>Determination</td><td>Permission</td><td>Shame</td></tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <p>Many psychological reversals often appear in groups (e.g. the identification with a behavior that's based on a belief).</p>
