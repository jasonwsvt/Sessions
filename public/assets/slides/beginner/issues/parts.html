        <h1>Issues - Parts</h1>
        <p>While it might not be true that all of you feels a particular way, consider whether it's true that part of you does.  It might not be something you can consciously recognize, so energy testing may be necessary to determine this.</p>
        <p>Here's an example: I love eating the whole box of crackers.</p>
        <p>This might energy test false, because there's a significant part of you that it really doesn't appeal to at all.</p>
        <p>The thing about parts is that it's pretty much always unnecessary to know details about the part itself, just whether they exist circumstantially, and possibly how many.</p>
        <p>Like this one: part of me loves eating the whole box of crackers.</p>
        <p>This on the other hand may energy test true, and if so it'll have reasons that could be cleared.</p>
