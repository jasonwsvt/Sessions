        <h1>Issues - Internal Conflict</h1>
        <p>Internal conflict is a psychological stress reaction to an undesired experience.</p>
		<p>What makes the experience undesired is the issue.</p>
        <p>It's this internal conflict that is cleared with energy work, and with the reduction or clearing of that stress, one may find the experience is no longer an issue.</p>
        <p>In some circumstances, people might even feel the issue never existed at all.</p>
