        <h1>Issues - Internal Conflict</h1>
        <p>Issues cause internal conflict, and internal conflict is a psychological stress reaction to an undesired experience.  The stressfulness of this conflict correlates to how undesired the experience is.  It's this internal conflict that is cleared with energy work, and with the reduction or clearing of that stress, one may find the experience is no longer an issue, or possibly even feel the issue never existed at all.  This is the power of energy work.</p>
