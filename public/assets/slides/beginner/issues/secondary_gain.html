        <h1>Issues - Secondary Gain</h1>
        <p>Secondary gain is a state where one sees advantages in keeping an issue.</p>
        <p>For example, perhaps someone is having trouble quitting smoking because they see it as a social break from their stressful day.  If secondary gain is experienced for an issue, the internal conflict experienced for the issue (smoking) would not be enough to overcome the internal conflict of losing the secondary gain (the excuse to have social breaks).</p>
