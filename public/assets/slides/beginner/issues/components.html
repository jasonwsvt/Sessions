        <h1>Issues - Sensations, Thoughts, and Emotions</h1>
        <p>On the most basic of levels, issue components are sensations, thoughts, or emotions that cause internal conflict.</p>
        <p>A sensation is something you feel, taste, see, hear, smell, or otherwise perceive.</p>
        <p>A thought is a generally complicated set of feelings that seem to just pop into consciousness and are typically situationally repetitive.</p>
        <p>If you hold the thought in mind you should be able to translate it into words and write them down.  Be as detailed as possible, and try to recognize any associated sensations.  In my experience, negative thoughts are very quick to clear with Because Reasons.  Following is an example.  Remember that these words are a verbal translation of a complex, quickly appearing thought.</p>
