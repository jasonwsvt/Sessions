        <h1>Issues - Sensations, Feelings, and Thoughts</h1>
        <p>On the most basic of levels, issues are the sensations, thoughts, or emotions that cause internal conflict.  A sensation is something you feel, taste, see, hear, smell, or otherwise perceive.  A feeling is an emotion, like happiness, sadness, anger, or despair.  A thought is a generally complicated set of feelings, ideas, memories, and images.</p>
        <p>A good practice, especially during energy work, is to hold the sensation, feeling, or thought in mind, and try to translate it into words, being as detailed as possible.  In my experience, undesired sensations, feelings, and thoughts, are very quick to clear with Because Reasons.  Following is a verbal translation of an undesired thought, with no associated sensations or emotions.</p>
        <p>"What is there to do?  Shouldn't I be doing something?  Am I missing something?  What am I missing?  I'm behind, right?  Behind on something?  I'm going to miss something I need to do if I don't stay alert.  I'm going to screw up and everything is going to go to hell if I miss something."</p>
        <p>Later I'm going to show how energy testing can be used to determine the reasons for issues like this one, and clear them.</p>
