        <h1>Issues - Sensations, Feelings, and Thoughts</h1>
        <p>On the most basic of levels, issues are the sensations, thoughts, or emotions that cause internal conflict.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A sensation is something you feel, taste, see, hear, smell, or otherwise perceive.</li>
            <li>A feeling is an emotion, like happiness, sadness, anger, or despair.</li>
            <li>A thought is a generally complicated set of feelings, ideas, memories, and images.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>A good practice, especially during energy work, is to hold the sensation, feeling, or thought in mind, and try to translate it into words, being as detailed as possible.</p>
        <p>In my experience, undesired sensations, feelings, and thoughts, are very quick to clear with Because Reasons.</p>
        <p>The following is an example of a verbal translation of an undesired thought, with no associated sensations, and some associated emotions.</p>
        <p><i>"What is there to do?  Shouldn't I be doing something?  Am I missing something?  What am I missing?
            <br>I'm behind, right?  Behind on something?  I'm going to miss something I need to do if I don't stay
            <br>alert.  I'm going to screw up and everything is going to go to hell if I miss something.
            <br>I'm feeling confused and exasperated and overwhelmed."</i></p>
        <p>Later I'm going to show how energy testing can be used to determine the reasons for issues like this one, and clear them.</p>
