        <h1>Issues - Components</h1>
        <p>On the most basic of levels, issues are the sensations, thoughts, behaviors, or emotions that cause internal conflict.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A sensation is something you feel, taste, see, hear, smell, or otherwise perceive.</li>
            <li>A feeling is an emotion, like happiness, sadness, anger, or despair.</li>
            <li>A behavior is a manner in which someone conducts themselves.</li>
            <li>A thought is a generally complicated set of feelings, ideas, memories, and images.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>A good practice, especially during energy work, is to hold the sensation, feeling, behavior, or thought in mind, and try to translate it into words, being as detailed as possible.</p>
        <p>In my experience, undesired sensations, feelings, behaviors, and thoughts, are very quick to clear with Because Reasons.</p>
        <p>All one needs to do is sufficiently determine all the underlying reasons.</p>
        <p>The primary purpose of these instructions is to show how energy testing can be used to determine the reasons for issues, and clear them.</p>
