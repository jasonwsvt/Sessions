        <h1>Issues - Negative Thoughts</h1>
        <p>
            Negative thoughts are generally complicated feelings that seem to just pop into consciousness and are typically situationally repetitive.  If you hold the thought in mind you should be able to translate it into words and write them down.  Be as detailed as possible, and try to recognize any associated sensations.  In my experience, negative thoughts are very quick to clear with Because Reasons.  Following is an example.  Remember that these words are a verbal translation of a complex, quickly appearing thought.

            "What is there to do?  Shouldn't I be doing something?  Am I missing something?  What am I missing?  I'm behind, right?  Behind on something?  I'm going to miss something I need to do if I don't stay alert.  I'm going to screw up and everything is going to go to hell if I miss something."
