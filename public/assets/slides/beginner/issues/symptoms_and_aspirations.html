            A symptom is something you’re experiencing, and it’s internally conflicting because you don’t want to experience it.  Energy work for a symptom would be on any sensations, thoughts or feelings you have for the symptom, and the energy tested reasons for why it exists.

            An aspiration is something you want to be or have, and it’s internally conflicting because you don’t currently experience it.  Energy work for one would be on all the sensations, thoughts, and feelings you’re experiencing due to not being or having this thing, any associated symptoms, and any other energy tested reasons for why it doesn’t exist.
