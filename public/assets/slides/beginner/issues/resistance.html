        <h1>Issues - Resistance</h1>
        <p>Resistance is any internal drive that opposes something being experienced.  Three major types of resistance that come up a lot in energy work are identification, attachment, and secondary gain.</p>
        <h2>Identification</h2>
        <p>Identification occurs when one believes something is a part of who they truly are, when it really isn't.</p>
        <p>If an issue is identified with, it does not cause internal conflict, or that internal conflict is consciously deflected or projected to a false source, and can not be cleared, but it’s still unhealthy and can still lead to lack of health.</p>
	    <p>For example, one may feel an issue is that of someone else, and the despair, anger, disgust, dislike, or whatever else they feel in reaction to it is perfectly reasonable.  In other words, they’ve identified with it.  Not to discount the actions of the other person, but reactions like these are unhealthy as well.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Attachment</h2>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <h2>Secondary Gain</h2>
        <p>Secondary gain is type of attachment where one sees advantages in keeping an issue.</p>
        <p>For example, perhaps someone is having trouble quitting smoking because they benefit from the excuse for social breaks during their stressful workdays.  If secondary gain is experienced for an issue, the internal conflict experienced for the issue (smoking) would not be enough to overcome the internal conflict of losing the secondary gain (the excuse to have social breaks).</p>
