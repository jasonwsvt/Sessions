        <h1>Issues - Overview</h1>
        <p>Because Reasons is a process of determination and resolution of issues, and issues are sensations, thoughts, behaviors, and feelings, that cause internal conflict.</p>
        <p>In this section weâ€™re going to touch upon what internal conflict is, along with how to identify basic sensations, thoughts, behaviors, and feelings, that cause it.</p>
        <p>We will also examine two primary causes of issues being unable to resolve, due to their negative affect on intention during the resolution process - identification and secondary gain.</p>
        <p>The first thing one must do, as the Buddha suggests, is to realize they are the witness of their sensations and feelings.</p>
