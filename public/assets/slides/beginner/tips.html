        <h2>Components don't need to make sense</h2>
        <p>The most important thing when determining components is that the issue and its underlying reasons energy test sufficiently true.  What really isn't important at all?  Whether or not they make sense.  The bottom line is, it might be fun to keep clarifying reasons to better understand them, but more often than not, it's really unnecessary.  My suggestion to anyone is to just determine as much of a reason as necessary to become sufficiently true, clear it, and move on to the next one.</p>

        <h2>Changes in Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Certain symptoms may be present at the onset of energy work, and periodically adjust after the clearing of a reason.  This is most typical, or at least recognizable, in the case of physical sensations, so I’ll use this as an example.  Imagine having a sharp pain in the neck.  After a few reasons are cleared, the sharpness may have reduced, and the location may have changed to your upper back.  After another few reasons are cleared, the pain may completely clear.  These changes in symptoms are fairly typical while doing energy work.  At the point you no longer feel symptoms, be sure to check for any remaining reasons, as any that still exist may have no sensational symptoms.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ongoing Issues</h2>
        <p>Often, multiple sessions are needed to completely clear an issue, and some time is often necessary for things to settle after a session ends.  If there is nothing more to clear for an issue after finishing all the provided work, but it’s still being experienced, put it on a list.  You can then periodically energy test to see if anything on your list has something ready to clear.  More tends to become available for me just before sleep, and just after waking.</p>
