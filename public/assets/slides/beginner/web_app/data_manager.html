            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>To export, import, or delete records, go to Data Management.</p>
                    <p>There are three columns of information.  The first shows all the field names, the second shows the values for the local data, and the third, once data is loaded, shows all the values for that data.</p>
                    <p>The blue button is a menu for several actions - Sort, Expand, Collapse, Hide, Select, Export, Merge, and Import, Delete.</p>
                    <p>Once selected, several options are shown to the right.</p>
                    <p>Buttons are hidden unless they're useful.  For example, <i>Import</i> is hidden until data is loaded, or the local data is changed through deletion or addition of records.  Similarly, options like <i>selected</i> are hidden until there are selected records.</p>
                    <p>To load exported data for merging or importing, click the <img src = "assets/images/data_manager_load_button.png"> button.</p>
                    <p>No actual changes are made until the Import action is started.</p>
                    <p>In the top left of each record is a button to expand, collapse, or hide records.  Click it to go to the next state, and ctrl+click it to go to the previous one.</p>
                    <p>In the bottom left of each record is a button to expand, collapse, or hide all the children of that record.  Click it to put all the children in the next state, and ctrl+click it to put them all in the previous one.</p>
                    <p>On the right side of the local and loaded data sections of each record, there are two checkboxes - one on top to select the record, and one on the bottom to select all the children.  The ones for the loaded records aren't visible until  data is loaded.</p>
