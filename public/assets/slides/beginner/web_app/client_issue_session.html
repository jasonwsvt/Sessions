        <h1>Web App - Client, Issue, and Session Utilities</h1>
        <p>The utilities for clients, issues, and sessions are basically the same.</p>
        <p>I guess the only concept you need to know is that there's a one-to-many relationship from users to clients, clients to issues, and issues to sessions.</p>
        <p>Most people will not use any other client than Self, at least until they become more of an advanced user.</p>

                    <h2>The Picker Menu</h2>
                    <img src = "/assets/images/picker_menu.png">
                    <p>The sections for Clients, Issues, and Sessions all have a picker menu.</p>
                    <p>For example, the client picker shows all the clients for the current user.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the session picker shows all the sessions for the current issue.</p>
                    <p>There are options to sort and search in each of these menus.</p>
                    <p>Until there is more than one record of a type, the picker menu will not show an arrow and won't open.  For instance, if you look at the image shown in the Rename Menu section, there is only one issue called New Issue.</p>
