        <h1>Web App - Client, Issue, and Session Utilities</h1>
        <p>The utilities for clients, issues, and sessions are basically the same.</p>
        <p>I guess the only concept you need to know is that there's a one-to-many relationship from users to clients, clients to issues, and issues to sessions.</p>
        <p>Most people will not use any other client than Self, at least until they become more of an advanced user.</p>

                    <p>The sections for Clients, Issues, and Sessions all have a picker menu.</p>
                    <p>For example, the client picker shows all the clients for the current user.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, the session picker shows all the sessions for the current issue.</p>
                    <p>There are options to sort and search in each of these menus.</p>

                    <p>You can rename the currently selected client or issue using the rename button in that session.</p>

                    <p>The default name for clients is New Client, and the default name for issues is New Issue.</p>
                    <p>If there is a client or issue with the default name, the new button for that section is disabled.  To re-enable it, rename the issue.</p>
