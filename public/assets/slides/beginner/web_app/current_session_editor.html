        <h1>Web App - Current Session Editor</h1>
        <p>I've designed this web app to be fairly robust and straight-forward in operation.  A lot of effort went into ensuring functionality is disabled when using it would cause problems, for example.  For the most part it works well.  There are some bugs I'm aware of, however, and there are likely more I'm not.  </p>
