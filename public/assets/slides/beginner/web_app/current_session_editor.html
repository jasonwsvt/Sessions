        <h1>Web App - Current Session Editor</h1>
        <p>The session editor is where a user enters the energy tested reasons for their issue.</p>
        <p>It works like any editor, but with significant limitations.</p>
        <p>The blinking line is the cursor and indicates where data will be entered.</p>
        <p>Typing any letter or number, or many symbols, adds that character at the cursor position.</p>
        <p>You can move the cursor around previously entered data by pressing the Up, Down, Left, or Right cursor keys.</p>
        <p>In Because Reasons, indentation is used to indicate underlying reasons.</p>
        <p>Pressing the Tab key will indent the current line up to one position further than the previous line.</p>
        <p>Pressing Shift+Tab will remove any amount of indentation.</p>
        <p>Pressing the Backspace key will remove the previous character.  If the cursor is already at the beginning of the line, the cursor and everything after it will move to the previous line.</p>
        <p>Pressing the Enter key will move everything after the cursor to the following line.  Indentation for the new line will be the same as the previous one.</p>
