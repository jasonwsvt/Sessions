        <h1>Web App - Overview</h1>
        <img src = "assets/images/overview.png">
        <p>The app has three areas, in order from top to bottom - the utility toolbar, the session editor, and the component buttons.</p>
        <p>Spanning the top of the window is the utility toolbar.  It consists of user, client, issue, and session utilities.</p>
        <p>Far to the right of the toolbar are buttons to adjust the size of the session editor and component buttons sections, and open the instructions.
            <br>No further explanation for these buttons is needed.</p>
        <p>I've tried to design this web app to be fairly robust and straight-forward in operation.</p>
        <p>You can use the app without creating an account.</p>
        <p>It won't back up anything you've done if you don't set the backup frequency in user settings.</p>
        <p>A lot of effort went into ensuring functionality is disabled when using it would cause problems.
            <br>For the most part it works well.</p>
        <p>There are some bugs I'm aware of, however, and there are likely more I'm not.</p>
        <p>My hope is there will be enough interest in the app and method to put further effort into its improvement.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind, this is my first web project, and it's been a solo endeavor from the beginning.
            <br>If you have suggestions for improvement, I welcome them.</p>
