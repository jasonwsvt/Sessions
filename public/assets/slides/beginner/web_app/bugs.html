        <ul>
            <li>In picker menus, when there are a large number of entries, the scroll bar should activate so the entries stay inside the menu.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, the records table needs to be cleaned up, like when a session has longer lines.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, deletion, merging, and importing all need to be tested and bug-checked further.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, there is currently no validation for loaded data, so invalid data will cause an error.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Ideas for future app features</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrate the info utility with the component buttons and automatically hide all irrelevant groups when showing particular slides.</li>
            <li>Add the option for server-side data storage and user accounts so users don't need to be limited to one browser on one computer.</li>
            <li>Create an Android / iPhone app</li>
