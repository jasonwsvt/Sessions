        <h1>Current bugs I'm aware of</h1>
        <p>This page is updated when a bug is discovered or fixed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no clear way for a new user to know the instructions are available by clicking the "i" button.</li>
            <li>On the utility toolbar, the buttons to the left of the instructions button that change the size of the editor and component buttons do not work on the heroku site, even though it works fine in Chrome on my development computer at home.</li>
            <li>In picker menus, when there are a large number of entries, the scroll bar should activate so the entries stay inside the menu.</li>
            <li>In the instructions, if the slide goes below the bottom of the page, it scrolls the whole page, not just the slide.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, the records table needs to be cleaned up, like when a session has longer lines.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, deletion, merging, and importing all need to be tested and bug-checked further.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, there is currently no validation for loaded data, so invalid data will cause an error.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Ideas for future app features</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrate the info utility with the component buttons and automatically hide all irrelevant groups when showing particular slides.</li>
            <li>Add the option for server-side data storage and user accounts so users don't need to be limited to one browser on one computer.</li>
            <li>Create an Android / iPhone app</li>
        </ul>
