        <h1>Current bugs I'm aware of</h1>
        <p>This page is updated when a bug is discovered or fixed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The new user button should disable itself when there is a user with "newuser" as the username, but this isn't always working properly.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the component buttons scrollbar shows on top of the info utility window.</li>
            <li>In the instructions, if the slide goes below the bottom of the page, it scrolls the whole page, not just the slide.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, the records table needs to be cleaned up, like when a session has longer lines.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, deletion, merging, and importing all need to be tested and bug-checked further.</li>
            <li>In the data manager, there is currently no validation for loaded data, so invalid data will cause an error.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Ideas for future app features</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Integrate the info utility with the component buttons and automatically show only pertinent groups when showing particular slides.</li>
            <li>Add the option for server-side data storage and user accounts so users don't need to be limited to one browser on one computer.</li>
            <li>Create an android / iPhone app</li>
        </ul>
