        <p>The first step to recognizing issues is really all about recognizing that you are not the sensations, feelings, and thoughts, that you experience; you are their witness.  As their witness, you can observe when they appear, and analyze them when they do.  Sometimes they're helpful, and sometimes they really just aren't.  Energy work provides someone the ability to clear those unhelpful sensations, feelings, and thoughts.</p>
