        <h1>Issue Resolution - A Yawn or Deep Breath:</h1>
        <p>Virtually every time I resolve something I involuntarily yawn or take a deep breath.  Energy testing indicates the reason for this is too complicated to figure out ... for me, anyways.  If a yawn or deep breath does not occur, this doesn’t mean the resolution didn’t happen.</p>
        <p>Have you ever experienced a yawn that felt deeply satisfying?  A yawn like that following resolution of an issue is a strong indicator of significant reduction of internal conflict.  If the yawn or deep breath is consciously unsatisfying, however, this is an indicator that more work likely needs to be done.  Regardless, it’s important to test whether a resolution was successful, or if more issues or underlying reasons exist.</p>
