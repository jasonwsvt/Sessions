        <h1>Issue Resolution - A Yawn or Deep Breath:</h1>
        <p>Virtually every time I resolve something I involuntarily yawn or take a deep breath.</p>
        <p>Energy testing indicates the reason for this is too complicated to figure out ... for me, anyways.</p>
        <p>If a yawn or deep breath does not occur, this doesn’t mean the resolution didn’t happen.</p>
        <p>Have you ever experienced a yawn that felt deeply satisfying?</p>
        <p>A yawn like that following resolution of an issue is a strong indicator of significant reduction of internal conflict.</p>
        <p>If the yawn or deep breath is consciously unsatisfying, however, this is an indicator that more work likely needs to be done.</p>
        <p>Regardless, it’s important to test whether a resolution was successful, or if more issues or underlying reasons exist.</p>
