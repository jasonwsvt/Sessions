        <h1>Issue Resolution - Somatic or Cognitive Response:</h1>
        <p>With many issue resolutions also occur a significant reduction or often a complete elimination of any associated sensations, thoughts, or feelings.  For example, one may feel the elimination of the "butterflies in my stomach" (a somatosensory stimulus) and rumination (a cognitive stimulus) one may experience before speaking publicly.</p>
