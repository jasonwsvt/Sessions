        <h1>Issue Resolution - Somatic or Cognitive Response:</h1>
        <p>After an issue is resolved, it's common to experience a significant reduction or often a complete elimination of any associated sensations, thoughts, or feelings.</p>
        <p>For example, one may feel the elimination of the "butterflies in my stomach" (a somatosensory stimulus) and rumination (a cognitive stimulus) one may experience before speaking publicly.</p>
