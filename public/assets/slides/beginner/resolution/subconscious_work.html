        <h1>Issue Resolution - Subconscious Work:</h1>
        <p>After the resolution command is given, the subconscious then works to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>The internal conflict for the components of the issue are reduced as much as possible, up to and including being cleared from the mind and body.</p>
        <p>The point to which each component's internal conflict is reduced is based on cognitive dissonance with remaining work on the given issue, including identification and attachment, along with associated issues.</p>
        <p>Cognitive dissonance is a psychologal term describing the tension one experiences between how they feel about the issue, and other associated beliefs and feelings they identify with.</p>
        <p>The way the subconscious resolves an issue could be described by elevation.  Imagine a helium balloon rising in a room with a ceiling.  The height of the ceiling in this room represents the highest point the issue can be resolved and not be cognitively dissonant.</p>
