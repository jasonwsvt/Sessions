        <h1>Issue Resolution - Subconscious Work:</h1>
        <p>After the resolution command is given, the subconscious then works to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>The way the subconscious resolves an issue is best described by elevation.</p>
		<p>Imagine a helium balloon on a string.  Resolving the issue is like taking away the ceiling.  The balloon then begins to rise.</p>
		<p>At a certain point, however, another celing may disable the balloon from going any higher.</p>
		<p>Ideally it's a point where there is no internal conflict.</p>
		<p>Alternatively, this point may be another issue, where a similar or entirely different internal conflict may be recognized.</p>
