        <h1>Issue Resolution - Subconscious Work:</h1>
        <p>After the resolution command is given, the subconscious then works to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>The internal conflict for the components of the issue are reduced as much as possible, up to and including being cleared from the mind and body.</p>
        <p>The point to which each component's internal conflict is reduced is based on cognitive dissonance with remaining work on the given issue, including identification and attachment, along with associated issues.</p>
