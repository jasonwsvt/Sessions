        <h1>Issue Resolution - Overview:</h1>
        <p>Weâ€™ve now covered issues, energy testing, and issue determination, and have a fairly good basis to learn about issue determination.  Resolution is the use of energy testing to clear sufficiently determined reasons for an issue.  The six steps to resolve an issue are as follows.  The remaining slides in this section will cover these steps in further detail.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the issue is sufficiently determined.</li>
            <li>The resolution command is given.</li>
            <li>Subconscious work is done.</li>
            <li>The energy tested response is provided.</li>
            <li>A yawn or deep breath may occur.</li>
            <li>A somatosensory or cognitive response may occur.</li>
        </ol>
