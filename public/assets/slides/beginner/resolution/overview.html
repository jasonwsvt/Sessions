            <li>Ensure the issue is sufficiently determined.</li>
            <li>The resolution command is given.</li>
            <li>Subconscious work is done.</li>
            <li>The energy tested response is provided.</li>
            <li>A yawn or deep breath may occur.</li>
            <li>A somatosensory or cognitive response may occur.</li>
