        <h1>Issue Resolution - Resolution Command:</h1>
        <p>You can then use a word to tell your subconscious (or your higher self, God, Source, whomever feels right to you), to resolve the issue.</p>
        <p>The meaning ascribed to this word needs to be something along the lines of “for all components, clear or elevate them to the highest state that is harmonic with all elements of the mind and body.”</p>
        <p>In the past, I went through phases using different words to indicate resolution, mostly “resolve,” “clear,” or “bam.”  Recently for me, resolution has usually been automatic and I don't need to think of a command word.</p>
        <p>Below are some well-known issue resolution commands from tv shows and movies:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>“kai”</td><td>(“dispel” in Japanese, from the anime series, <i>Naruto</i>)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>“goosfraba”</td><td>(from the movie, <i>Anger Management</i>)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>“serenity now”</td><td>(from the TV show, <i>Seinfeld</i>)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>“nanu ami tofu dah”</td><td>(from the movie, <i>Mulan</i>)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>“episkey”</td><td>(healing spell, from <i>the Harry Potter</i> series)</td></tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <p>You're welcome to use one of them, or any other word.</p>
        <p>Not to take the fun out of it, but it's very important to keep in mind that it's the meaning of the word that's important, and not to allow that meaning to be clouded by the word's novelty.</p>
