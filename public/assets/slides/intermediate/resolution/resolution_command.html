        <h1>Issue Resolution - Resolution Command:</h1>
        <p>You can then use a word to tell your subconscious (or your higher self, God, Source, whomever feels right to you), to resolve the issue.  The meaning ascribed to this word needs to be something along the lines of “for all components, clear or elevate them to the highest state that is harmonic with all elements of the mind and body.”  In the past, I went through phases using different words to indicate resolution, mostly “resolve,” “clear,” or “bam.”  Before you get set in your ways, why not start off using something fun?  You can thank me later.  Just remember, it's not the word that's important, but the meaning.</p>
