        <h1>Issue Resolution - Energy Test Response:</h1>
        <p>The energy tested response to a resolution command provides information about the resolutionâ€™s success.  A true response indicates a successful resolution, a false one indicates that further detail or specificity needs to be determined, likely in the form of underlying reasons, and something other than true or false tends to mean that the resolution was partially successful, but more detail or specificity needs to be determined, likely in the form of underlying reasons.</p>
