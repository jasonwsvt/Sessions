        <h1>Process - Ongoing Issues</h1>
        <p>Often, multiple sessions are needed to completely clear an issue, and some time is often necessary for things to settle after a session ends.  If there is nothing more to clear for an issue after finishing all the provided work, but itâ€™s still being experienced, put it on a list.  You can then periodically energy test to see if anything on your list has something ready to clear.  More tends to become available for me just before sleep, and just after waking.</p>
