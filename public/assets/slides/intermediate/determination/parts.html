        <h1>Determination - Parts:</h1>
        <p>When parts come up as reasons, in my experience, anyways, they have always been determined to be statements like "certain parts of me believe they know X", where X is something like "what's best for me in this situation," "the right way to do something," "how to deal with this situation," "how a certain person should have acted," etc.</p>
        <p>While further detail is usually needed to describe the situation, the word "certain" has always been sufficient. In other words, determining an actual number of parts, or further detail regarding those parts, has never been necessary.</p>
