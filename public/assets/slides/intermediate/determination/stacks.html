        <h1>Issue Determination - Stacks:</h1>
        <p>In my energy work I've seen an interesting aspect of attachment that I've termed stacking.</p>
        <p>I'm unsure whether it occurs with any other psychological reversal, or any other aspect of energy work.</p>
        <p>A two attachment stack, for instance, is an attachment to an attachment.</p>
        <p>Attachment stacks can be small, or exceptionally high in number.</p>
        <p>Often an amount in the pentillion-illions tests true.</p>
        <p>But in my experience, it's usually sufficiently true to determine number of attachment stacks along with the number of attachments in each stack.</p>
        <p>Once these have been determined, the speed at which an issue clears has been quite remarkable.</p>
