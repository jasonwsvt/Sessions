        <h1>Issue Determination - Emotions:</h1>
        <p>On the following slide is a significantly expanded list of emotions and consciousness levels that I put together, which is based on the seventeen levels of Dr. Hawkins's Map of Consciousness.  Note the font color and background color are the same as shown in the previous chart.</p>
        <p>One characteristic of all emotions is that they are experienced and felt at a specific consciousness level.  However, an emotion’s consciousness level is situational – it likely won’t be exactly the same all the time, but they tend toward one to a few values.</p>
