        <h1>Issue Determination - Emotions:</h1>
        <p>Now that we've learned about Dr. David Hawkins' map of consciousness, and its seventeen levels, I'm going to have you recall the list of emotions I showed you in the beginner section.</p>
        <p>Each level in the map can be described as an emotion with a consciousness level, and the same is true of all emotions.</p>
        <p>However, an emotion’s consciousness level is situational – it likely won’t be exactly the same all the time, but they tend toward one to a few values.</p>
        <p>An interesting thing to point out is that the seventeen levels can be thought of as distinct groups, where each group contains all the emotions between itself and the emotion just before the following group.  Each of these groups often appears in energy work.</p>
        <p>On the following slide I show the list of emotions again, but this time each is shown with a typical consciousness level.</p>
