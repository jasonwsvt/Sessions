        <h1>Numbers - Determining the value of a one digit number:</h1>
        <p>To determine a number between 0 and 9, I find it helpful to imagine the numbers in this format:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Low</th><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
            <tr><th>Medium</th><td></td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr>
            <tr><th>High</th><td></td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>I then use a modified binary search to find the number by doing the following:</p>
        <p>1) I energy test whether the number is low, medium, or high.</p>
        <p>2) I then energy test which number it is in that group.</p>
        <p>For an example, I'll search for the number 8:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Test</th><th>Response</th></tr>
            <tr><td>The number is in the low group.</td><td>False.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The number is in the medium group.</td><td>False.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>By elimination it is known the number is in the high group.  The number is 7.</td><td>False.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>The number is 8.</td><td>True.</td></tr>
        </table>
