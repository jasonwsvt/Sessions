        <h1>Numbers - Between One and a Million or so:</h1>
        <p>When I need to find a number and the range of that number is unknown, here's the general process I use:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine the precision necessary for sufficient determination.  The precision is always between 0 and 12.
            </li>
            <li>The range minimum is 0.  Determine the range maximum by energy testing the lowest number in following list that's above the one you're searching for:
                <table>
                    <tr><th>One</th><th>Thousand</th><th>Million</th></tr>
                    <tr><td></td><td>1,000</td><td>1,000,000</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>10</td><td>10,000</td><td>10,000,000</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>100</td><td>100,000</td><td>100,000,000</td></tr>
                </table>
            </li>
            <li>If the precision isn't 0, use the binary search method to find the number.</li>
        </ol>
