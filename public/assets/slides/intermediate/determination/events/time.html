        <h1>Issue Determination - Events - Time:</h1>
        <p>Periodically, a determination of an amount of time needs to be made.  The best way to do this is to determine the number of unit of measure, then determine the amount for each unit.</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>Instants</td><td>Seconds</td><td>Minutes</td><td>Hours</td><td>Days</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Weeks</td><td>Months</td><td>Years</td><td>Decades</td><td>Centuries</td></tr>
        </table>
        <br>
        <p>For example, after determining that a duration of time is needed to be determined, one could determine the number of components to a time to be 3, then determine each of the components to be hours, days, and months, then determine the specific values of those components to be 5, 6, and 1.</p>
