                    <p>In David Hawkins' last book, Letting Go, he provides a set of basic principles that support the self-healing process (pages 294-298). The selected ones shown below are great suggestions for when learning to do any energy work.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make a decision that freedom is more desirable than having a negative feeling.</li>
                        <li>Choose to surrender negative feelings rather than express them.</li>
                        <li>No matter what is going on in life, keep the steadfast intention to surrender negative feelings as they arise.</li>
                        <li>Relinquish negative feelings but share positive ones.</li>
                        <li>Surrender resistance to and skepticism about positive feelings.</li>
                       <li>Persistence pays off. Some symptoms or illnesses may disappear promptly; others may take months or years if the condition is very chronic.</li>
