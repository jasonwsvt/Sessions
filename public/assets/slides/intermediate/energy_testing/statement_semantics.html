        <h1>Energy Testing - Statement Semantics</h1>
        <p>Consider the following statement:</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">“I never said they stole my money.”</p>
        <p>The meaning of this statement changes depending on which words have emphasis.</p>
        <p>Consider the implication of saying it in one of the following ways:</p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Statement</th><th>Possible implication</th></tr>
            <tr><td>“I never <i>said</i> they stole my money.”</td><td>Perhaps it happened but this person kept quiet?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>“I never said <i>they</i> stole my money.”</td><td>Perhaps someone else stole it?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>“I never said they <i>stole</i> my money.”</td><td>Perhaps this person gave it to them?</td></tr>
            <tr><td>“I never said they stole my <i>money</i>.”</td><td>Perhaps they stole something else?</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>Similar consideration must be taken when putting together statements to energy test.</p>
