        <h1>Energy Testing - Improving Responses</h1>
        <p>If a response is not a solid true or false, it means that what you are testing needs to be adjusted in some way.</p>
        <p>Declarative statements are the best things to energy test, along with thoughts that can be easily translated to declarative statements.</p>
        <p>If the energy tested response to a declarative statement isn’t a solid true or false, it’s likely that one or more of the words needs to be changed.</p>
        <p>Typically for me, an adjective that has an implicit magnitude needs to be changed.  Regardless, however, you can use energy testing to determine the ways in which the statement needs to be adjusted.</p>
