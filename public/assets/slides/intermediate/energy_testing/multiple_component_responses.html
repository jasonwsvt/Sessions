        <h1>Energy Testing - Multiple Component Responses</h1>
        <p>The response to an energy test that is done with the eye method I described earlier is not limited to a single component.  Responses could include two or more components, and they may repeat themselves.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples of responses with multiple components.  I indicate repetition by using an ellipsis (…).</p>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Test</th><th>Repeated response</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Not even close</td><td>False</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Not really</td><td>Short true → long false…</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Kinda / sorta</td><td>True → false…</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Really close!</td><td>Long true → short false…</td></tr>
            <tr><td>You got it!</td><td>True</td></tr>
        </table>
