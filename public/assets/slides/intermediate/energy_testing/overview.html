        <h1>Energy Testing - Overview</h1>
        <p>In the beginner section on energy testing I discussed the scientific basis, history, methods and practitioners.  I also went over truth and falsity as the basis for energy test responses, and the basic steps for energy testing.  I then discussed the method I use, in which I observe involuntary contractions in specific muscles around my eyes, and how energy testing is used in Because Reasons.  In this section I will discuss statement semantics, avoiding influence, improving responses, and the binary search method.</p>
