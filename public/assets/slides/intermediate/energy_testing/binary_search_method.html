        <h1>Energy Testing - Binary Search Method</h1>
        <p>In addition to intuition, a method I use to quickly locate emotions, psychological reversals, body parts, subjective units of distress, quantities, percentages, magnitudes, and other values, pretty much everything, actually, is called Binary Search.  Itâ€™s quite simple.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>If needed, energy test the minimum and maximum of the range.</li>
            <li>Energy test whether the value sought is in half the set of values.</li>
            <li>If so, repeat step two with half the tested set of values.</li>
            <li>If not, repeat step two with half the untested set of values.</li>
        </ol>
