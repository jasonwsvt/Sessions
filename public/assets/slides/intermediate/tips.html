        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <h2>It gets easier</h2>
        <p>As you continue to use the technique, self energy testing will become second nature.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Automatic resolution</h2>
        <p>You may find that after enough conscious initiation of issue resolution, many issues will automatically resolve the moment you sufficiently determine them, or even bring them into consciousness, without the need to explicitly command resolution, or possibly even determine them at all.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Component grouping</h2>
        <p>Components tend to group.  For example, initially reasons may present with individual emotions, then grouped (e.g. all emotions in the Fear group - 100-108 or 100-124, or all emotions from 100 to 199), to everything within a type of component (e.g. all emotions or all psychological reversals), to different component types being grouped together (e.g. all emotions and psychological reversals as a single group).</p>
