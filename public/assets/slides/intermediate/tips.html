        <h1>Tips</h1>
        <h2>It gets easier</h2>
        <p>As you continue to use the technique, self energy testing will become second nature, and recalling portions of the component map will become easier.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Automatic resolution</h2>
        <p>You may find that after enough conscious initiation of issue resolution, many issues will automatically resolve the moment you sufficiently determine them, or even bring them into consciousness, without the need to explicitly command resolution, or possibly even determine them at all.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Components might not even need to be determined</h2>
        <p>For any given component, just knowing it exists might be all that's necessary to determine.  This is usually the case when you're working on a reason and yawn unexpectedly.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Component grouping</h2>
        <p>Components tend to group.  For example, initially reasons may present with individual emotions, then grouped (e.g. all emotions in the Fear group - 100-108 or 100-124, or all emotions from 100 to 199), to everything within a type of component (e.g. all emotions or all psychological reversals), to different component types being grouped together (e.g. all emotions and psychological reversals as a single group).</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Listen to your body</h2>
        <p>An alternative way of determining issues is to pay attention to your energy testing muscles and see what they're responding with naturally.  Any included disharmony in the response would be your issue, and the reasons to clear for the issue would be everything necessary to adjust the response so that it's neutral, positive.</p>
