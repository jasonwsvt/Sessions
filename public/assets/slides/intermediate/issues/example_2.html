        <h1>Issues - Example</h1>
        <p>Clearing the tail-ender: "what will people think of me when they find out I'm not full of joy already?"</p>
        <p>There are three anticipated reasons, and the first one contains one component - an action: perfect.  I think it's meant as an adjective.</p>
        <p>I'm not entirely okay with people knowing I'm not perfect.  I mean, what would it say about my healing technique?  That tests true, and it automatically clears.</p>
        <p>The second reason has two components.  The first one is something we'll go over in the advanced section (sorry, I don't anticipate these things).  It clears quickly.  The second one is another of the same type, and it clears a few seconds later.</p>
        <p>The third reason also has two components.  The first one is Location -> Civilization -> Town.  The second component is Item Characteristics -> Intended Use -> Informational.  That doesn't make any sense to me, but it's sufficient, and clears.</p>
        <p>There are now no remaining reasons, and when I think about using the affirmation, "My mind and heart are full of joy," I'm not getting that tail-ender anymore.</p>
        <p>There's nothing remaining to clear before working on the affirmation, so I'll do that on the next slide.</p>
