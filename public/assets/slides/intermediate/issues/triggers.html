        <h1>Issues - Triggers:</h1>
        <p>A trigger is something that occurs externally and causes someone to experience a negative sensation, feeling, or thought.</p>
        <p>It might also cause someone to react with a certain behavior.</p>
        <p>Typically the experience is the recall of a memory of an event, but that's not required for an issue to be considered a trigger.</p>
        <p>Effective energy work for a trigger usually requires examining specific aspects of the causes of the trigger, or the associated memory, and for each aspect, determing the reasons for identification with it, or attachment to it.</p>
