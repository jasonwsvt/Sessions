        <h1>Issues - Secondary Gain</h1>
        <p>
            Secondary gain is a state where one sees advantages in keeping an issue.  Perhaps someone is having trouble quitting smoking because they see it as a social break from their stressful day.  If secondary gain is experienced for an issue, the internal conflict experienced for the issue (smoking) is not enough to overcome the internal conflict they experience from loss of secondary gain (the social break), or even the idea of its potential loss.
