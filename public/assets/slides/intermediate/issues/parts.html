        <h1>Issues - Parts:</h1>
        <p>We covered parts in the beginner section, but there are some more advanced statements that could be used when figuring out a statement to use as an issue.</p>
        <p>These statements are more general and will pick up more reasons if there are any.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"A number of parts of me are driven in some way to do / think / feel this thing."</li>
            <li>"Parts of me are driven in any way to eat more than a minimally necessary amount."</li>
        </ul>
