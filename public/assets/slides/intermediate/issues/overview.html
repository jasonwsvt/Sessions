        <h1>Issues - Overview</h1>
        <p>
            Recall that issues are collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict.  In the beginner issues section I discussed internal conflict, identification, secondary gain, and sensations, emotions, and thoughts.  In this intermediate section, I'll discuss aspirations, affirmations, tail-enders, and triggers.
