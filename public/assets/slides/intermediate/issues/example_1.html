        <h1>Issues - Example</h1>
        <p>For an example I'm going to find an affirmation that really resonates with me.</p>
        <p>From the <a href = "https://motivationping.com/affirmations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Positive Affirmations</a> site I referenced previously, I chose "My mind and heart are full of joy."</p>
        <p>I chose it not only because I feel my mind and heart could be more full of joy, but also because of a big tail-ender I felt when I was considering it.  Of course it's just an instantaneous thought that popped into consciousness, but putting it into words I get "what will people think of me when they find out I'm not full of joy already?"</p>
        <p>So first I'm going to clear the tail-ender, because that's really important - it'll stop an issue from clearing if it's strong enough.</p>
        <p>And then afterward I'll clear the resistance to the affirmation.</p>
