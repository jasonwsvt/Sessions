        <h1>Issues - Tail Enders</h1>
        <p>
            Tail enders are those tiny negative thoughts or limiting beliefs you might experience after saying an affirmational statement or something you aspire to attain, that says something like “in your dreams,” “no chance, it’s way too hard” or “just you wait – you’re not going to be able to be self sufficient doing that.”

            You may be used to thinking something along the lines of “oh shoot, that’s right” after hearing them, so identification can play a part here, along with a possible corresponding lack of internal conflict.  Look out for these tail enders and treat them as issues when you find them.
