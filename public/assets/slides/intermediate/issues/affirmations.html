        <h1>Issues - Affirmations</h1>
        <p>An affirmation is a statement of positive assertion that you would like to be true about yourself.</p>
        <p>Essentially it’s the same thing as an aspiration, but I believe affirmations are generally less personal and less specific.</p>
        <p>Energy work for one would be on all the sensations, thoughts, behaviors, and feelings you’re experiencing due to not being, having, or feeling this thing, any associated symptoms, and any other energy tested reasons for why it doesn’t exist.</p>
        <p>Check out these sites for lists of aspirations:</p>
