        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I grew up with lots of self-diagnosed issues - mild to moderate depression, low self-esteem, low confidence, excessive self-consciousness, shyness / social anxiety, difficulty focusing / concentrating, and hypersomnia.</p>
        <p>In 2003 I graduated from the Unversity of Vermont with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science.
        <p>In the summer of 2009 I worked with Glenn Cratty, an energy psychotherapist at Circle of Healing in Pawlet, Vermont.  At the end of ten or so sessions, after learning energy testing, several energy psychology methods including the Be Set Free Fast technique (BSFF), the Tapas Acupressure Technique (TAT), and Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), and using them to significantly reduce many of the issues I was experiencing, I still had a ways to go, but I finally felt as though I could rejoin society.</p>
        <p>After finishing work with Glenn in 2009, I became quite good at energy testing with the technique that Glenn had taught me, and started using it to determine which energy psychology method I should use, as well as forming statements for use with EFT.  This was the birth of Because Reasons.  Over the several years that followed, the determination map I used expanded as my understanding of the method grew.</p>
        <p>Over the years, my drive grew to help people heal in the same way I did.  The information presented on this website was first prepared as a book, then as a website, then as a presentation, then as a video presentation.  In 2020 I was certified as an Energy Psychology Practitioner by Energy Psychology Group.  Shortly afterward I became insured through the Energy Medicine Professional Association.  Over countless hours starting in May, 2020, this website went from an idea, through several iterations, to the state it is in today.  I feel the interactivity it supports is immensely important for people to learn this invaluable healing tool.</p>
