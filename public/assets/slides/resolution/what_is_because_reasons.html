        <h1>What is Because Reasons?</h1>
        <p style = "text-align: center">Because Reasons is a <b>process</b> of <b>determination</b> and <b><u>resolution</u></b> of <b>issues</b> using <b>energy testing</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Process:</b>
            <br>A series of actions and operations that bring about a desired result.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Issues:</b>
            <br>Collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Energy Testing:</b>
            <br>The observation of a specific natural response in the body to controlled stimuli.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Determination:</b>
            <br>The process of using energy testing to find all the reasons that underlie an issue.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b><u>Resolution:</u></b>
            <br>The use of energy testing to clear sufficiently determined reasons for an issue.
        </p>
        <h2>So far we’ve covered issues and energy testing.  At this point I believe knowing a bit about resolution is important before learning about determination, so we’re going to cover that first.</h2>
