                <td>So I highly suggest to you: 1) strive for Love and Peace, and only go below if you are pursuing rigorous scientific truth, and 2) look inside yourself, and when you find anything that isnâ€™t grounded in Love, not just love for self, or love for a select group, but Love for everyone and everything, use a method that really works for you to clear it.  I wish you the best of luck on your path.</td>
