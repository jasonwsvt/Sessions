                <br>Natalie Marchant is the principal investigator and senior research fellow at University College London's Department of Mental Health of Older People within UCL's Division of Psychiatry.

                <br>In the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, vol. 44, no. 3, pp 755-770, 2015, a study lead by Dr. Marchant suggests that repetitive negative thinking (including depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, neuroticism, life stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder) increase the risk for Alzheimer's disease.</td>
