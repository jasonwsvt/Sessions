        <h1>Why another energy healing technique?</h1>
        <p>With all the other well-established techniques, is there really a need for another?</p>
        <p>There are a few features of my technique that, in my opinion, make it easier, faster, and more effective than others:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your subconscious tells you everything that needs to heal.</li>
            <li>Most issues include only one to a dozen or so reasons.</li>
            <li>The reason clearing process is typically instantaneous.</li>
            <li>Issue symptoms tend to go away shortly after the issue's last reason is resolved.</li>
        </ol>
