        <h1>What are Unhealthy Emotions?</h1>
        <p>The Map of Consciousness is a chart that was created by Dr. Hawkins, who I just mentioned. I'm unable to display it here due to a strict copyright, but it includes a list of sixteen levels, and corresponding numerical values, or consciousness levels, shown below.  Dr. Hawkins describes all the levels below Courage as unhealthy.</p>

        <p>The Map of Consciousness is a chart that was created by Dr. Hawkins. I'm unable to display it here due to a strict copyright, but it includes the list of sixteen levels, and corresponding numerical values, or consciousness levels, shown above.  There is a seventeenth level, Enlightenment, from consciousness level 700 to 1000, but not only is enlightenment not really a focus of this presentation, it also doesn’t fit neatly into the four by four grid I made for the other 16.  In any case, Dr. Hawkins describes all the levels that calibrate below 200 (shame, doubt, apathy, grief, fear, desire, anger, and pride), as unhealthy.  Later I’ll go over how these consciousness levels are determined.</p>
