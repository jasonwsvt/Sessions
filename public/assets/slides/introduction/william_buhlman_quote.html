                <td>“Our personal evolution largely depends on the way we focus, control, and direct our thought-energy. No matter what dimension we inhabit, our personal responsibility for our thoughts and actions is absolute. All thoughts are creative; both positive and negative thoughts and action will create a corresponding restructuring of the immediate nonphysical environment.  This is why spiritual leaders have always stressed themes of “do unto others” and “love for all.” Once you fully recognize the power of your thoughts, you will never again create or hold a negative or destructive image in your mind. Negative and self-limiting thoughts are the real enemy we must face.”<br><span style = 'text-align: right'>― William Buhlman, Adventures Beyond the Body</span><br><br>William Buhlman works in the field of out of body experiences as a workshop conductor and author of four books.<br><a href = "https://astralinfo.org">https://astralinfo.org</a></td>
