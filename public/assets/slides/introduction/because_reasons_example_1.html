        <h1>So what does this actually look like?</h1>
        <p>
            A quick example:
            <br>Issue: I don’t like creating this presentation.  It’s a whole lot of work and it might end up being a waste of time.
        </p>
        <p>For the issue, let’s use, I don’t like creating this presentation.  It’s a lot of work and it might end up being a waste of time.
        <br>So how does it energy test?  True.
        <br>Remember with energy testing I’m thinking or saying a statement (I don’t like creating this presentation), and observing a response (true), indicating how harmonious it is to my subconscious, by sensing the contraction of a certain muscle above my eye.</p>
