                <td>“When the mind is dominated by a negative worldview, the direct result is a repetition of minute changes in energy flow to the various body organs.  The subtle field of overall physiology is affected by electron transfer, neural hormonal balance, nutritional status, and the like.  Eventually, an accumulation of infinitesimal changes becomes discernible through measurement techniques, such as electron microscopy, magnetic imaging, x-ray, or biochemical analysis – but by the time these changes are detectable, the disease process is already quite advanced.  …  If this scheme of disease formation is correct, then all illness should be reversible by changing thought patterns and habitual responses.”<br><span style = 'text-align: right'>― Dr. David R.
