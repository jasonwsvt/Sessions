        <p>Dawson Church, PhD, is an award-winning science writer with three best-selling books to his credit. The Genie in Your Genes (<a href = "YourGeniusGene.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YourGeniusGene.com</a>) was the first book to demonstrate that emotions drive gene expression.  Mind to Matter, (<a href = "MindToMatter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MindToMatter.com</a>) showed that the brain creates much of what we think of as “objective reality.” Bliss Brain (<a href = "BlissBrain.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlissBrain.com</a>) demonstrates that peak mental states rapidly remodel the brain for happiness. Dawson has conducted <a href = "https://search.nih.gov/search/docs?affiliate=nih&dc=3785&query=dawson+church" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dozens of clinical trials</a>, and founded the National Institute for Integrative Healthcare (<a href = "NIIH.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIIH.org</a>) to promote groundbreaking new treatments. Its largest program, the <a href = "https://stressproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veterans Stress Project</a>, has offered free treatment to over 20,000 veterans with PTSD over the past decade. Dawson shares how to apply these health and performance breakthroughs through EFT Universe (<a href = "EFTUniverse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFTUniverse.com</a>), one of the largest alternative medicine sites on the web.<br><a href = "https://dawsonchurch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dawsonchurch.com</a></p>
