        <h1>What are Unhealthy Emotions?</h1>
        <p>So far we’ve learned that negative thoughts and emotions are implicated in disease by respected people in spirituality and science, and that examples of negative thinking include depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, neuroticism, life stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
        <p>Emotions are at the root of all negative thoughts, so how do we know if an emotion is unhealthy?</p>
        <p>The Map of Consciousness is a chart that was created by Dr. Hawkins, who I introduced in the Quotes section. I'm unable to display it here due to a strict copyright, but it includes a list of sixteen levels, and corresponding numerical values, or consciousness levels, shown below.  There is a seventeenth level, Enlightenment, from consciousness level 700 to 1000, but not only is enlightenment not really a focus of this presentation, it also doesn’t fit neatly into the four by four grid I made for the other 16.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hawkins describes all the levels that calibrate below 200 (shame, doubt, apathy, grief, fear, desire, anger, and pride), as unhealthy.  He also describes all the levels that calibrate at 200 or above (courage, neutrality, willingness, acceptance, reason, love, joy, peace, and enlightenment) as healthy.  Later I’ll go over how these consciousness levels are determined.</p>
