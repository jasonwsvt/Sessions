        <h1>An invitation</h1>
        <p>The technique I’ve developed over the past eleven years has successfully treated depression, social anxiety, low confidence, low self-esteem, poor self-image, excessive self-consciousness, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating, all of which I had experienced for as long as I can remember.</p>
        <p>It also ended a more than fifteen year stint of hypersomnia.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but it also has ended the pain from bee stings, stomachaches, headaches, and, wait for it, hiccups.</p>
        <p>Something it has done for me daily is reliably, effectively, rapidly resolve simple emotional issues - fear, sadness, anxiety, anger, frustration, pain, etc.</p>
        <p>The experience of an undesired sensation or thought releasing from consciousness, whether it’s a physical pain, or an emotional one, has never lost its novelty.</p>
        <p>Would you like to learn how to do it?</p>
        <p>Take a quick look at the navigation section above.  Right now the Introduction section is highlighted on the first tier.  The tier of buttons below show the contents of the Introduction section.  You're currently on the Invitation slide, which is the first slide on this tier.</p>
        <p>The rest of the Introduction section will give readers a better idea of what this type of healing is all about.</p>
        <p>The next stop is Quotes, and to get there you can either click on Quotes, or move your mouse over the right third of the screen and click.</p>
        <p>Once there you'll notice that a third tier of slides will appear.  Go through each slide on the third tier before continuing to the next slide on the second tier, Mind-Body Connection.</p>
        <p>If you're already familiar with other energy healing methods, and would like to go right to where I start talking about my method, you're welcome to click the Overview button instead.</p>
