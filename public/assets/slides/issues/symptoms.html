        <h1>Issues - Symptoms</h1>
        <p>
            A symptom is something you’re experiencing, and it’s internally conflicting because you don’t want to experience it.  Energy work for a symptom would be on any sensations, thoughts or feelings you have for the symptom, and the energy tested reasons for why it exists.
