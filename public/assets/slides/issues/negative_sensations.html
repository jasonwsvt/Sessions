        <h1>Issues - Negative Sensations</h1>
        <p>
            A negative sensation is something you feel, taste, see, hear, or smell, that you donâ€™t want to experience.  Energy work for one would be on any sensations, thoughts or feelings you have for the negative sensation, and the energy tested reasons for why it exists.
