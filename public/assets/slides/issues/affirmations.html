        <p>
            An affirmation is a statement of positive assertion that you would like to be true about yourself.  Essentially itâ€™s the same thing as an aspiration, but I believe affirmations are generally less personal and less specific.  Here are two great lists of affirmations you can access online.  Any energy work would be the same as for an aspiration.
