        <h1>Issues - Negative Thoughts</h1>
        <p>
            Negative thoughts are generally complicated feelings that seem to just pop into consciousness and are typically situationally repetitive.  If you hold the thought in mind you should be able to translate it into words and write them down.  Be as detailed as possible, and try to recognize any associated sensations.  In my experience, negative thoughts are very quick to clear with Because Reasons.
