        <h1>Issues - Aspirations</h1>
        <p>
            An aspiration is something you want to be or have, and it’s internally conflicting because you don’t currently experience it.  Energy work for one would be on all the sensations, thoughts, and feelings you’re experiencing due to not being or having this thing, any associated symptoms, and any other energy tested reasons for why it doesn’t exist.
