        <h1>Issues</h1>
        <p>The only thing that can really be said about issues at an advanced level is that you can determine or fine-tune them in the same way as an issue's reasons.</p>
        <p>Try energy testing the percent accuracy of an issue you've brought to consciousness.</p>
        <p>You might find the issue more accurate if one or more of the words are changed, and you can use energy testing to determine which words would need to change, and the correct components they would change to.</p>
        <p>If the issue resonates better with you, you know you're on the right track.</p>
