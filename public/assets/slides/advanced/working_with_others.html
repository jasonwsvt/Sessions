                    <p>Because Reasons works very well for working with other people and animals, even at a distance.</p>
                    <p>I highly recommend being comfortably familiar with all the information in every level of these instructions, and have a lot of experience working with yourself, before starting to work with others, even on an informal basis.</p>
                    <p>Consent is necessary from the recipient or their legal guardian before beginning the work.</p>
                    <p>For pets and people who are incapable of providing consent, such as those in a coma, in addition to receiving their legal guardianâ€™s consent, you must also communicate with their higher self and receive consent from them through energy testing.</p>
                    <p>It's necessary to follow ethical standards when doing any work with others.</p>
                    <p>Because of this, I highly suggest reading the Ethics Handbook for Energy Healing Practitioners by David Feinstein with Donna Eden, before doing any such work.</p>
