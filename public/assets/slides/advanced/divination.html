        <h1>Process - Divination</h1>
        <p>In addition to healing, the Because Reasons system can very readily provide answers to questions one might ask a psychic or medium.  Instead of asking questions, however, one must adjust the question into the form of a statement.  Responses to statements about the future are based on most likely potential future timelines, and will be heavily altered by any relevant lessons one might need to learn.  Because of this, any issues related to a statement that are not cleared before energy testing will certainly adjust the response.  As such, the most difficult parts of this process are determination of components, and possibly getting out of your own way.  With energy testing one may divine answers to literally anything.  Here are some possible applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>dream interpretation</li>
            <li>communication with those who have passed on</li>
            <li>suggestions for improvement of progress toward goals</li>
            <li>life purposes</li>
            <li>suggested issues to work on</li>
            <li>information about past or future lives</li>
        </ul>
