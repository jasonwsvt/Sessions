        <h1>Numbers - Very Small and Large Numbers:</h1>
        <p>Previously we learned how to determine a number between one and a million or so.</p>
        <p>For especially large numbers, or particularly small numbers between 0 and 1, I use scientific notation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mantissa: An adjusted value of the actual number, where the decimal point is moved just after the first non-zero digit.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Range: Real numbers between 0 and 10.</li>
            <li>Precision: The number of digits in the mantissa that are necessary to determine.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Range: Integers, usually between 0 and 12.</li>
            <li>Power: The number of places the decimal point must move so that it's just after the first non-zero digit.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Range: Integers, usually between -1000 and 1000.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Here's the general process I use:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine each digit of the power</li>
            <li>Determine the precision</li>
            <li>Determine each digit of the mantissa, to the required precision.</li>
        </ol>
        <table>
            <tr><th>Secret Number</th><th>Binary Search for the precision</th>
                <th>Binary Search for the power</th><th>Binary Search for the mantissa</th><th>Energy Tested Number</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>23.9</td><td>10</td>
                <td>10.0-45.0: True; 10.0-23.0: False; 23.1-45: True; 23.5-23.9: True; 23.8-23.9: True; 23.8: False; 23.9: True</td>
            </tr>
