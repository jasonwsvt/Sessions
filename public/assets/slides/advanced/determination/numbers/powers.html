        <h1>Numbers - Nonstandard Powers:</h1>
        <p>So now we know how to determine numbers that can reasonably be expressed by a number multiplied by ten to the power of some relatively small integer.  What about even larger numbers?  Scientific notation utilizes a single expression of power.  To express even larger numbers, where the number used as the power is exceptionally high, a second power could be used.  A set of up to six powers might be necessary to express a number sufficiently.</p>
        <p>The general format is B<sup>P<sup>Q<sup>R<sup>S<sup>T<sup>U</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> (read B to the P to the Q to the R to the S to the T to the U), and would replace the 10<sup>P</sup> in the standard scientific notation.</p>
        <p>Remember the important thing here is not that you understand what's going on, but that the number you determine is sufficiently true.</p>
        <p>Here's the general process I use:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine whether 10 is sufficient to be used for A, or if another integer should be used.</li>
            <li>Determine the number of powers (typically between 0 and 6).</li>
            <li>Determine the integer for each power (all are typically under 1000).</li>
        </ol>
