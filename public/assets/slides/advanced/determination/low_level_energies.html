        <h1>Issue Determination - Low Level Energies:</h1>
        <p>While people can experience emotions at 0 and 1 (fullstop and death usually calibrate there), low consciousness level energies (LLEs) calibrate to real numbers between 0 and 1.</p>
        <p>They take the form of a negative recurrent thought, emotion, or sensation.  These LLEs are fairly common, and in my experience they have not been anything to get overly worried about.</p>
        <p>LLEs can be sufficiently determined by finding three values: the range maximum, the range minimum (usually zero), and the level of the LLE within that range, though sometimes itâ€™s not necessary.</p>
        <p>Clearing or resolution for LLEs is called transmutation, which effectively means to return the energy to Source.</p>
