        <h1>Issue Determination - Parts:</h1>
        <p>Traditionally, parts are used in psychotherapy that includes energy testing as parts of ones self that have a symptom or an aspiring trait. For example, "there exist parts of me that know how to be happy," "these parts can teach the others how to be happy," and "the parts that know how to be happy are now teaching the others how to do so."
        <p>When parts come up in Because Reasons, so far they have always been determined to be statements: "certain parts of me believe they know X", where X is something like "what's best for me in this situation," "the right way to do something," "how to deal with this situation," "how a certain person should have acted," etc.</p>
        <p>While further detail is usually needed to describe the situation, the word "certain" has always been sufficient. In other words, determining an actual number of parts, or further detail regarding those parts, has never been necessary.</p>
