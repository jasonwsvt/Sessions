        <h1>Issue Determination - Energy System - Chakras:</h1>
        <p>The first seven chakras (root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, crown) are well known, and fairly well understood, along with, to a lesser extent, the minor chakras in various locations around the body. However, not only these chakras show up in energy work, but others, from 8 to 105. While the first seven chakras seem to have very clear characteristics, and all have connections to all the others that sometimes need to be healed, While I have not been able to determine the unique characteristics of the higher ones individually, I have been able to determine some detail regarding their grouping.</p>
        <p>To make sense of the chart on the next slide, please recall the Source - Creator System, with Creator, Creator Parent, Creator One, Maker, and Source, and that every organism has a self in each of these entities.  Also recall the subtle energy bodies chart I provided in the previous level, with the seven chakras, and correlated bodies, aspects, and organs.  On the next slide I will show how all of these fit together.</p>
        <p>It may work best to move back and forth between the chart and this slide as you read these points.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each plane - Physical, Energy, Creator, Creator Parent, Creator One, Maker, and Source, each have chakras that correspond to individuals, and to all.</li>
            <li>The self has seven bodies, aspects, and organs, and each has eight corresponding chakras, one in each plane.</li>
            <li>There are equivalents to Body, Aspect, and Organ for the All portion of the chart, though what they are I haven't been able to determine.</li>
        </ul>
