        <h1>Issue Determination - Planar Witness System - Chakras:</h1>
        <p>The first seven chakras (root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, crown) are well known, and fairly well understood, along with, to a lesser extent, the minor chakras in various locations around the body. However, not only these chakras show up in energy work, but others.  They extend out in a similar manner to the first seven, so it makes sense to enumerate them from 8 to 105.</p>
        <p>The first seven chakras seem to have very clear characteristics, and all have connections to all the others that sometimes need to be healed.  While I have not been able to determine the unique characteristics of the higher ones individually, I have been able to determine some detail regarding their grouping, and I will explain this further on the following slide.</p>
