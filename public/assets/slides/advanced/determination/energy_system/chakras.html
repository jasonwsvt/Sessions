        <h1>Issue Determination - Energy System - Chakras:</h1>
        <p>The first seven chakras (root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, crown) are well known, and fairly well understood, along with, to a lesser extent, the minor chakras in various locations around the body. However, not only these chakras show up in energy work, but others, from 8 to 105. While the first seven chakras seem to have very clear characteristics, and all have connections to all the others that sometimes need to be healed, While I have not been able to determine the unique characteristics of the higher ones individually, I have been able to determine some detail regarding their grouping.</p>
        <p>To make sense of the chart on the next slide, please recall the Source - Creator System, with Creator, Creator Parent, Creator One, Maker, and Source, and that every organism has a self in each of these entities.  Also recall the subtle energy bodies chart I provided in the previous level, with the seven chakras, and correlated bodies, aspects, and organs.  On the next slide I will show how all of these fit together.</p>
        <p>It may work best to move back and forth between the chart and this slide as you read these points.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Subtle Energy Bodies information, as explained earlier, only included the first seven chakras.  With this new information, each body, aspect and organ corresponds to the whole row of eight chakras, each chakra corresponding to a different plane.</li>
            <li>Each plane - Physical, Energy, Creator, Creator Parent, Creator One, Maker, and Source, has seven chakras that correspond to Self, and seven other chakras that correspond to All.  For example, chakras 1 - 7 correspond to the Physical Self, and chakras 8 to 14 correspond to the All portion of the physical plane.</li>
            <li>The Body, Aspect and Organ portions are shown on the chart as only corresponding to the Self.  There are equivalents to these concepts for the All portion of the chart, though I haven't been able to determine what they are.</li>
            <li>The Witness is situated to the right of Source, and there is no All counterpart to the Witness Self.  In the chain analogy, Witness is now the final link.  In the Venn Diagram analogy, Witness is now the outermost circle.  I'm still trying to determine how the tree analogy needs to be adjusted to include Witness.</li>
        </ul>
