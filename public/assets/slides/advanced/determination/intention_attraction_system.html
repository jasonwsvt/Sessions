        <h1>Issue Determination - Intention / Attraction System</h1>
        <p>My understanding of this system is not complete.  My understanding of it has grown as I have continued to clear issues with portions of it as components.  As my understanding of it has grown, I have adjusted the system to fit the available data.  It might be beneficial to move between this slide and the next while reading the following points.</p>
        <p>Here are some observations I've made about this system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The system is an eight tier by fourteen level grid to which an individual's chakras attach.</li>
            <li>Each tier has a minimally acceptable consciousness level that is acceptable for intention.
                <br>As the tier increases, the minimally acceptable CL decreases.</li>
            <li>Each level is associated with one chakra, for which an individual has fourteen.</li>
            <li>Levels 1 - 7 are associated with an individual's self, and correlate to the seven chakras with which we are familiar.
                <br>As an individual controls their intention, they control the placement of their lower seven chakras.</li>
            <li>levels 8 - 14 and their associated chakras are associated with an individual's experience.
                <br>The individual's subconscious controls the placement of the higher seven chakras.
                <br>My understanding is that their placement is based upon desired learning.</li>
            <li>Each chakra, and the one or two nodes to which it is attached, are attracted to each other in a way that shapes all of an individual's experiences.</li>
            <li>My understaning as to why tiers 4 and 5 have the same minimally accepted intention consciousness level is that tier 4 pertains to thoughts, and tier 5 pertains to actions.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>There are three rules of this system of which I'm aware:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Chakras can only attach to one node, or two nodes on adjacent tiers.</li>
            <li>Adjacent chakras must have at least one attached tier in common.</li>
            <li>A new attraction can be strong enough to break previously set attachments, and will do so if necessary to maintain the previous two rules.</li>
        </ul>
