        <h1>Issue Determination - Intention / Attraction System</h1>
        <p>Some observations I've made about this system are shown below.</p>
        <p>It might be beneficial to move between this slide and the next while reading the following points.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The system is an eight tier by fourteen level grid to which an individual's chakras connect.</li>
            <li>Each tier has a minimum consciousness level that is acceptable for intention.
                <br>As the tier increases, the minimally acceptable consciousness level decreases.</li>
            <li>Each level is associated with one chakra, for which an individual has fourteen.</li>
            <li>Levels 1 - 7 are associated with an individual's self, and correlate to the seven chakras with which we are familiar.
                <br>As an individual controls their intention, they control the placement of their lower seven chakras.</li>
            <li>levels 8 - 14 and their associated chakras are associated with an individual's experience.
                <br>The individual's subconscious controls their placement, and my understanding is that it's based upon desired learning.</li>
            <li>An individual's experiences are shaped by each chakra connection.</li>
            <li>My understanding as to why tiers 4 and 5 have the same minimally accepted intention consciousness level is that tier 4 pertains to thoughts, and tier 5 pertains to actions.</li>
            <li>Chakras can have connections within one tier, or two adjacent tiers.</li>
            <li>Adjacent chakras must have at least one connected tier in common.</li>
            <li>A new attraction can be strong enough to break previously set connections, and will do so if necessary to maintain the previous two rules.</li>
        </ul>
