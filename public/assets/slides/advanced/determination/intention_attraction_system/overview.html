        <h1>Issue Determination - Intention / Attraction System</h1>
        <p>My understanding of this system is not complete, but it has grown as I have continued to clear issues with portions of it as components.</p>
        <p>Every individual has a subtle connection to everything with which they identify, to which they are attached, and with which they interact.</p>
        <p>Each of these subtle connections has an intrinsic consciousness level.</p>
        <p>The consciousness level of the connection is the consciousness level of the intention of the identification, attachment, or interaction.</p>
        <p>An intention is the desired result an individual has for the connection.</p>
        <p>The Intention / Attraction System connects individuals to a source of further attraction to experiences similar to the consciousness level of the intention.</p>
        <p>The system causes experiences in that consciousness level range to be attracted to the individual until the connection is cleared.</p>
        <p>Strong connections will prevail over weak ones, until the individual has the conscious intention to release them.</p>
        <p>When a connection is cleared, it doesn't mean the repercussions of the initial event will stop manifesting.</p>
