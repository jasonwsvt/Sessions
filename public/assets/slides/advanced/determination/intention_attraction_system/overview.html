        <h1>Issue Determination - Intention / Attraction System</h1>
        <p>My understanding of this system is not complete, but it has grown as I have continued to clear issues with portions of it as components.</p>
        <p>Every individual has a subtle connection to everything with which they identify, to which they are attached, and with which they interact.</p>
        <p>The consciousness level with which an individual connects to something has to do with their intention: the desired result an individual has for the identification, attachment, or interaction.</p>
        <p>Once the individual is connected, the Intention / Attraction System then provides individuals with experiences of similar consciousness level to that of the intention.</p>
        <p>Experiences in that consciousness level range are attracted to the individual until the connection is broken or released.</p>
        <p>Strong connections will prevail over weak ones, but no connection is stronger than the conscious intention to release it.</p>
        <p>As with all issues, sufficient determination of the characteristics of the connection is required for its release.</p>
        <p>When a connection is established, it sets in motion various consequences to the action.</p>
        <p>While the consequences of a connection continue to occur after the connection's release, the attraction to new experiences of similar consciousness level does not.</p>
