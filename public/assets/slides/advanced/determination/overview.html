        <h1>Issue Determination - Overview:</h1>
        <p>Because Reasons is a process of determination and resolution of issues using energy testing, and determination is the process of using energy testing to find all the reasons that underlie an issue.  On the next several slides I will detail many of the components that are often contained within reasons, and afterward I’ll go through an example Because Reasons session to better explain how all these components are found and used to clear issues.</p>
        <p>For the cynic or scientist, the Because Reasons map can be divided into three groups: quasi-believable, not so believable, and downright absurd.  Regardless, all of these components I will describe in this section come up in the determination process either as things to be healed or otherwise cleared from the body, or entities doing a healing.  Usually you need to determine the thing to be healed, rarely do you need to determine the entity doing the healing (in my experience it has usually been my higher self), and extremely rarely do you need to determine both.</p>
        <p>I feel it’s important to make it abundantly clear that while this is list a great place to start, and so far it has been complete for me, components from other systems may make the process even faster.  I imagine the fields of traditional medicine and shamanism, western medicine, psychotherapy, genetics, epigenetics, and anatomy, could all be greatly expanded upon.  Components from these or other systems may test true for you.</p>
