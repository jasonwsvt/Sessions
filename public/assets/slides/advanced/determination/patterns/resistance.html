        <h1>Issue Determination - Patterns:</h1>
        <p>Patterns are learned through life and block the ability to determine an issueâ€™s reasons.  A pattern may contain any number of the examples below, and many usually appear in groups I call pattern stacks.</p>

            <tr><td>Belief system</td><td>A set of beliefs one has about what is right or wrong.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Behavior</td><td>The way someone conducts themself.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Identification</td><td>This occurs when someone does not see any separation between themself and something, like a belief or behavior, possibly to the point of being blind to its existance.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Attachment</td><td>An emotional bond one may have with something, like a belief or behavior.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Resistance</td><td>The reluctance one might have in accepting or recognizing an identification or an attachment to an issue.</td></tr>
