        <h1>Issue Determination - Conjunctions:</h1>
        <p>In the following table I show a list of 22 conjunctions.  Just like other parts of my technique, I determined these terms by trial and error, but while the other parts are fairly straightforward, I would venture to say most of  these donâ€™t make any sense at all.  Finding a term, using it in a reason, having the reason test true, and having the issue I was experiencing resolve, when other methods were not offered, serves as significant positive reinforcement.</p>
        <table>
            <tr><td>and</td><td># (pound)</td><td>section of</td><td>subset/section of</td></tr>
            <tr><td>xnor</td><td>! (bang)</td><td>subset of</td><td>subset|section of</td></tr>
            <tr><td>(group)</td><td>- (dash)</td><td>| (states)</td><td>& (ampersand)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>,</td><td>cross</td><td>crossed by</td><td>cross/crossed by</td></tr>
            <tr><td>at</td><td>(at/)above</td><td>(at/)below</td><td>(at/)between</td></tr>
            <tr><td>with</td><td>without</td><td> </td><td> </td></tr>
        </table>

        <p>I have been able to glean a little regarding how some of these conjunctions work:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When conjunctions connect components it is like the components are either broken or enmeshed.</li>
            <li>Energy healing for conjunct terms heals them so that they are no longer broken, or at least less so.</li>
            <li>While the term "and" groups two components, "&" is more of an inclusive range between the two components.</li>
            <li>"Bang" (!) works with all emotions from the emotion or consciousness level specified down to 0.</li>
            <li>"At" works with one consciousness level.</li>
            <li>"above" works with the range of consciousness levels just above the given one to infinity.</li>
            <li>"below" works with the range of consciousness levels just below given one down to zero.</li>
            <li>"between" works with the range of consciousness levels between but not including the given two.</li>
            <li>"at/above" works with the range of consciousness levels from the given one to infinity.</li>
            <li>"at/below" works with the range of consciousness levels from the given one down to zero.</li>
            <li>"at/between" works with the range of consciousness levels between and including the given two.</li>
        </ul>
