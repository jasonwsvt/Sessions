        <h2>Keep it up!</h2>
        <p>Healing takes effort, and time.  You won't be healed in a day, or likely in a year.  But with effective tools, and those two things - time and effort - you should see continual progress.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Think outside the box!</h2>
        <p>I haven't come across every situation.  If you're having trouble figuring something out, all is not lost.  Use your intuition.  Ask your subconscious what it can tell you that might help you in the right direction.  Try to hone in on the truth.</p>
        <p>I know you can do it.</p>
