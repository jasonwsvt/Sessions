        <h2>Keep it up!</h2>
        <p>Healing takes effort, and time.</p>
        <p>You won't be healed in a day, or likely in a year.</p>
        <p>But with effective tools, and those two things - time and effort - you should see continual progress.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Think outside the box!</h2>
        <p>I haven't come across every situation.</p>
        <p>If you're having trouble figuring something out, all is not lost.</p>
        <p>Use your intuition.</p>
        <p>Ask your subconscious what it can tell you that might help you in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Try to hone in on the truth.</p>
        <p>I know you can do it.</p>
