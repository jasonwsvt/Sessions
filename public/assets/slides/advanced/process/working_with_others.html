        <h1>Process - Working With Others</h1>
        <p>Because Reasons works very well for working with other people and animals, even at a distance.  Consent is necessary from the recipient or their guardian before beginning the work.  For pets and people who are incapable of providing consent, such as those in a coma, in addition to receiving their guardianâ€™s consent, you must also communicate with their higher self and receive consent from them through energy testing.</p>

                <td>It's necessary to follow ethical standards when doing any work with others.  Because of this, I highly suggest reading the Ethics Handbook for Energy Healing Practitioners by David Feinstein with Donna Eden, before doing any such work.</td>
