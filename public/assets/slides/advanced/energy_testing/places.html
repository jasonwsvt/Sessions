        <h1>Numbers - Determining the number of places in a number:</h1>
        <p>When the range of a number is unknown, I use the following method to determine it.</p>
        <p>The short list below is very helpful when determining the number of places in a number:</p>
        <p>one, ten, hundred, thousand, million, X-illion, X-illion^Y</p>
        <p>Here's the general process I use:</p>
        <p>1) Determine the lowest amount that's above the number being sought.</p>
        <p>2) Determine the number of places necessary to be determined.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples:</p>
        <p>To determine the number 8, I would first determine the range of the number - 10, and then finish by using the digit determination method I described on the previous slide.</p>
        <p>To determine the number 23, I would first determine the range - 100, and then I'd use the digit determination method for each of the two places.</p>
        <p>To determine the number 52,340,000, I would first determine the range - million.  I would then determine whether it's 1, 10, or 100 million, and find that it's 100 million.  I would then determine the number of places needed to determine - 4.  Then use the digit determination method on the previous slide for each of those places.</p>
        <p>X - illion is short for billion, trillion, quadrillion, etc.</p>
