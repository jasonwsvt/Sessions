        <h1>Energy Testing - Binary Search Method</h1>
        <p>Here is a very simple example.  Suppose we’re searching for a number, and we know this number is between 1 and 100.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Observations</th><th>Test</th><th>Response</th>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>Since we know the number is between 1 and 100, I’m going to start by searching the lower half of that range.</td><td>The number is between 1 and 50.</td><td>True</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Since the number is between 1 and 50, I’m going to search the lower half of that range.</td><td>Between 1 and 25.</td><td>False</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Since the number is not between 1 and 25, I’m going to take the other half of 1 to 50, which is 26 to 50, and search the lower half: 26 through 38.</td><td>Between 26 and 38.</td><td>True</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Since the number is between 26 and 38, I’m going to search the lower half: 26 to 32.</td><td>26 and 32.</td><td>False</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Since the number is not between 26 and 32, I’m going to take the other half of 26 through 38, which is 33 to 38, and search the lower half: 33 to 35.</td><td>33 and 35.</td><td>True</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Since the number is between 33 and 35, and the lower half is between 1 and two units, I’m going to just test whether the first unit of that range (33) is the value.</td><td>33.</td><td>False</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Since 33 wasn’t the value, I’m going to test the next value in the 33 to 35 range: 34.</td><td>34.</td><td>True</td></tr>
            <tr><td>And I find that 34 is the correct value.</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
        </table>
