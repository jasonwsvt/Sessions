        <h1 style = "text-align: center">What is Because Reasons?</h1>
        <p style = "text-align: center">Because Reasons is a <b>process</b> of <b>determination</b> and <b>resolution</b> of <b>issues</b> using <b><u>energy testing</u></b>.</p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Process</b>:
            <br>A series of actions and operations that bring about a desired result.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Issues</b>:
            <br>Collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b><u>Energy Testing</u></b>:
            <br>The observation of a specific natural response in the body to controlled stimuli.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Determination</b>:
            <br>The process of using energy testing to find all the reasons that underlie an issue.
        </p>
        <p style = "text-align: center">
            <b>Resolution</b>:
            <br>The use of energy testing to clear sufficiently determined reasons for an issue.
        </p>
        <h3>So now we know about what issues are in terms of Because Reasons: collections of sensations, thoughts, and feelings, that cause internal conflict, and that components like unhealthy emotions and beliefs that are justified or identified with will not be recognized as issues.  We’ll get into components more in the section on Determination, but now we’re going to cover energy testing.</h3>
